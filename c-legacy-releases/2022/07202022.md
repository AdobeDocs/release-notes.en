### Provisioning update

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Please review the following notice regarding Experience Cloud provisioning.

Adobe is updating its provisioning to provide all Experience Cloud customers access to foundational capabilities that aid interoperability between some Experience Cloud products. Users will have Adobe Experience Platform as a new entitlement added to their Experience Cloud organizations, with [!UICONTROL Data Collection] as an included service. 

Adobe Experience Platform [!UICONTROL Data Collection] includes [tags](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/tags.html) for simplified universal tag management, and offers a trusted, robust, and complete, streaming data infrastructure. Tags simplify customer experience data collection and streamlines experience delivery. 

**Changes in Admin Console**

Administrators could see changes or additions to the Admin Console as follows:

* The Adobe Experience Platform product card in the Admin Console will include:

  * Places
  * Assurance
  * Identity Namespace
  * Sandboxes
  * Experience Data Model
  * Schemas
  * Datastreams
  * Visitor ID

   For organizations that are not currently using Experience Platform, you will now see the _Adobe Experience Platform_ product in the Admin Console, including the capabilities listed above.

   For organizations currently using Experience Platform, _Places_ will now be consolidated into the Experience Platform card.

* Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection (formerly, Launch) and Privacy will continue to appear as separate product cards from the other Experience Platform capabilities.

### Experience Manager [!DNL Sites] as a [!DNL Cloud Service]

New features in [!DNL Sites]:

* A [new user interface](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/sites/administering/content-fragments/content-fragments-console.html) is now available for content admins and content authors to efficiently manage (take actions such as publish, unpublish, copy, and move), search/filter, and create content fragments for Headless use-cases.

* The new [Table of Contents Component](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/components/tableofcontents.html) works not only with the [!UICONTROL Core Components] but with all components, automatically rendering table of contents on content pages. And, because it is rendered server-side and fully cached by the dispatcher, it is also efficient to load.

### Experience Manager [!DNL Assets] as a [!DNL Cloud Service]

New features in [!DNL Assets]:

* Experience Manager [!DNL Assets] uses Adobe Sensei AI capabilities to now [distinguish between colors in an image and apply those as tags automatically on ingestion](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/manage/color-tag-images.html). These tags enable enhanced Search experience, based on image color composition. You can configure the number of colors, within a range of one to forty, that are tagged to an image so that you can search for images based on those colors later.

### Experience Manager Forms as a Cloud Service

New features in [!DNL Forms]:

**Wizard to create an Adaptive Form:** You can use business user friendly wizard to quickly author [!UICONTROL Adaptive Forms]. The wizard provides a quick tab navigation to easily select pre-configured template, styling, fields, and submission options to create an adaptive form.

### Experience Manager as a Cloud Service Foundation

What's new:

As mentioned in the May (2022.5.0) release notes, the "Add tree" option under the replication agent admin screen's Distribute tab was removed. Packages with a tree hierarchy of content should instead be replicated using Manage Publication or the Publish Content Tree workflow.

### [!DNL Cloud Manager]

What's New:

* [!DNL Cloud Manager] users can now access useful video tutorials from the [!UICONTROL Welcome] card on the landing page at any time.

* The popover on the [Restore Content](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/operations/backup.html) tab of the environments details page now displays a handy list of git commands allowing the user to view changes locally.

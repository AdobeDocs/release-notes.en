  _New feature in prerelease channel_

These tags enable enhanced Search experience, based on image color composition.

  _New features in prerelease channel_

    _New features_

  * The **[!UICONTROL Add tree]** option under the replication agent admin screen’s **[!UICONTROL Distribute]** tab, which was previously announced as deprecated, will be removed on June 20, 2022 or soon thereafter. Packages with a tree hierarchy of content should instead be replicated using [Manage Publication](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/operations/replication.html?lang=en#manage-publication) or the [Publish Content Tree workflow](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/operations/replication.html?lang=en#publish-content-tree-workflow).
  * Using the replication agent admin screen or replication API for distributing content packages larger than 10 MB (nodes with properties, not including binaries) is deprecated and will be enforced on September 12, 2022 or soon thereafter. Instead, [Manage Publication](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/operations/replication.html?lang=en#manage-publication) or the [Publish Content Tree workflow](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/operations/replication.html?lang=en#publish-content-tree-workflow) must be used to replicate these large content packages. In July 2022, a warning message appears in the replication agent admin screen’s **[!UICONTROL Distribute]** tab. It appears if you are attempting to replicate these large content packages and also in the Experience Manager error log whenever the replication API is used to replicate these large content packages. In September, warnings will be replaced by errors. Adobe recommends that you adjust your processes accordingly.

  _New feature in prerelease channel_

  * Experience Manager as a Cloud Service is now integrated with Unified Shell to improve the user experience and unify it with all the other Experience Cloud applications. See [Experience Manager as a Cloud Service on Unified Shell](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/overview/aem-cloud-service-on-unified-shell.html?lang=en) for more details.

* **Experience Manager as a Cloud Service Foundation Security** 

  * **Deprecation of TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1** &ndash; Starting June 30, 2022, Experience Manager as a Cloud Service will require a more secure network communication and data exchange with users systems. Experience Manager will use exclusively TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.2 protocol. TLS 1.0 and 1.1 will be deprecated.
  
    If you continue to use TLS 1.0 or TLS 1.1, you could potentially lose access to Experience Manager as a Cloud Service.

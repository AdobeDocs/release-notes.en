_Early adopter program_

* **[Protect your documents with DocAssurance APIs (Part of Communication APIs)](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/using-communications/aem-forms-cloud-service-communications-introduction.html?lang=en#document-assurance-doc-assurance)** &ndash; The DocAssurance APIs empower you to safeguard sensitive information by signing and encrypting the documents. Through encryption, the contents of a document are transformed into an unreadable format, ensuring that only authorized users can gain access. This fortified layer of protection not only shields valuable data from unauthorized eyes but also provides peace of mind. The Signature APIs let your organization protect the security and privacy of Adobe PDF documents that it distributes and receives. This service uses digital signatures and certification to ensure that only intended recipients can alter documents.

  Send an email to [aem-forms-early-adopter-program@adobe.com](mailto:aem-forms-early-adopter-program@adobe.com) from your official email id if you want to join the early adopter program.

* **[Headless Adaptive Forms](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-headless-adaptive-forms/using/overview.html?lang=en)** &ndash; Use Headless adaptive forms to let developers create, publish, and manage interactive forms that can be accessed and interacted with through APIs, rather than through a traditional graphical user interface. Headless adaptive forms help you:

  * build high-quality multi-channel forms in the programming language of your choice
  * natively integrate forms to your desktop and mobile apps, websites, and chat applications
  * reuse your proprietary user interface components with forms applications
  * use the power of AEM Forms

  Send an email to [aem-forms-headless@adobe.com](mailto:aem-forms-headless@adobe.com) from your official email ID to join the early adopter program.

### [!DNL Experience Manager] as a [!DNL Cloud Service Foundation]

* **New CDN caching behavior for campaign-related URL parameters** &ndash; For new environments, the CDN removes marketing-related query parameters by default to increase marketing campaign performance and cache hit ratios. Existing environments are unaffected. [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/content-delivery/caching.html?lang=en#marketing-parameters).
* **Traffic Filter Rules (including WAF Rules) early adopter program** &ndash; Filter traffic at the CDN based on the following:

  * request headers and properties (for example, IP address)
  * known traffic patterns that are associated with malicious traffic

  Interested in trying out the feature and sharing feedback? To learn more about the early adopter program, send an email to [aemcs-waf-adopter@adobe.com](mailto:aemcs-waf-adopter@adobe.com) from your official email ID. Space is limited.

  Learn more about the feature in the article [here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/security/cdn-and-waf-rules.html?lang=en).

### [!DNL Cloud Manager]

_New features_

* CDN logs, when available, can be downloaded by way of the Cloud Manager UI.
* Users can now opt-in to include Experience Audit testing powered by Google LightHouse in non-production, full-stack pipelines.

_Early adopter program_

Be a part of Adobe's early adopter program and have a chance to test some upcoming features.

* **Self-Service Content Restore** &ndash; [A new self-service content restore feature](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/operations/restore.html?lang=en) now provides backup restoration for up to seven days and is available to early adopters for evaluation purposes featuring:

  * Point-in-time backup restoration for the previous 24 hours.
  * Fixed time restorations for up to seven days.

  If you are interested in testing this new feature and sharing your feedback, send an email to [aemcs-restorefrombackup-adopter@adobe.com](mailto:aemcs-restorefrombackup-adopter@adobe.com) from your email associated with your Adobe ID. Be aware of the following:

  * The early adopter program is limited to development environments only.
  * Availability of the early adopter program of this feature is limited.
  * This feature is for recovering accidentally deleted content and is not intended for disaster recovery.

* **Experience Audit Dashboard** &ndash; [The Cloud Manager Experience Audit dashboard](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/using-cloud-manager/test-results/experience-audit-dashboard.html) includes a trended view of your page performance scores along with insights and recommendations to help you improve them. Experience Audit is included as a step in the Cloud Manager production pipeline.

  The dashboard uses Google Lighthouse, an open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of your web apps. You can run it against any web page that is public, or requires authentication. It has audits for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, SEO, and more.

  Interested in test-driving the new dashboard? Send an email to [aem-lighthouse-pilot@adobe.com](mailto:aem-lighthouse-pilot@adobe.com) from your email associated with your Adobe ID and Adobe can get you started.

**Bug fixes**

* When a program is deleted, any associated running pipeline is now also deleted.
* If a pipeline is in progress, the Send button of the Go-live complete dialog is now disabled and informs the user that the go-live date can't be set because of the running pipeline.
* An occasional error has been fixed where all steps of a pipeline execution were marked as completed, but the status of the pipeline was still running, giving the appearance of a stuck state.

### [!DNL Workfront for Experience Manager] enhanced connector

The release date for the latest version 1.9.13 of Workfront for Experience Manager enhanced connector is September 11, 2023.

_Release highlights_

The latest version of the Workfront for Experience Manager enhanced connector includes the following updates:

* Experience Manager enhanced connector fetches all event subscriptions from Workfront while deleting an event subscription for a project, which leads to a performance impact on the application.
* When an asset is sent from Workfront to Experience Manager, the asset MIME type is not set to `dc:format` attribute within Experience Manager.
* Workfront project IDs stored on Experience Manager enhanced connector include duplicates.

>[!NOTE]
>
>AEM 6.4 is now end of extended support. For more details, see Adobe's [technical support periods](https://helpx.adobe.com/support/programs/eol-matrix.html). Find the [supported versions here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/?lang=en).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Adobe recommends that you [upgrade to the latest 1.9.13 version](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/integrations/workfront-connector-install.html?lang=en) of the Workfront for Experience Manager enhanced connector.

_Known issues_

* While configuring project linked folders with AEM 6.4, [!DNL Experience Manager] does not save the values for **sub-folders** and **Create linked folder in projects with portfolio** fields. The value for the **sub-folders** field updates to **undefined**. The value for the **Create linked folder in projects with portfolio** field updates to **Default Portfolio** automatically after saving the configuration.
* When you use the classic Workfront experience, the **Send to** option available in the **More** drop-down list does not let you select the target destination within Experience Manager. The **Send to** option works correctly using the **Document Actions** drop-down list. The **Send to** option works correctly for **More** drop-down list and the **Document Actions** drop-down list available in the new Workfront experience.

Updates and new content for [!DNL Audience Manager].

+++Details

Existing customers can continue using their [!DNL DIL] implementation. However, Adobe is not developing [!DNL DIL] beyond this point. Customers are encouraged to evaluate the [Experience Platform Web SDK](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/home.html?lang=en) for their long-term data collection strategy. Customers looking to implement new data collection integrations after July 2023 should use [Experience Platform Web SDK](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/home.html?lang=en) instead.

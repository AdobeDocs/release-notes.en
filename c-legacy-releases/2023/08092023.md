### [!DNL Experience Manager Sites] as a [!DNL Cloud Service] 

_New feature_

### [!DNL Experience Manager Assets] as a [!DNL Cloud Service]

_New features_

_New features_

* **[Out of the box themes and templates](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/adaptive-forms-authoring/authoring-adaptive-forms-core-components/create-an-adaptive-form-on-forms-cs/using-themes-in-core-components.html?lang=en)** &ndash; Kickstart your form creation process with Adobe's ready-to-use, out-of-the-box themes and templates, tailored to empower both seasoned professionals and new forms authors.

* Natively integrate forms to your desktop and mobile apps, websites, and chat applications
* Reuse your proprietary UI components with forms applications

* If a development [pipeline](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/using-cloud-manager/cicd-pipelines/introduction-ci-cd-pipelines.html?lang=en) contains no testing steps, users can optionally include testing steps when they [start the pipeline](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/using-cloud-manager/cicd-pipelines/managing-pipelines.html?lang=en#running-pipelines).

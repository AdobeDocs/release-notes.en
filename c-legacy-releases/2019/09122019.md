### New features, enhancements, and fixes in Adobe Analytics {#aa-features}

| Feature    | Description  |
| -----------| ---------- |  
|**Journey IQ: Cross-Device Analytics** | In September 2019, Adobe Analytics is introducing a powerful new feature called Journey IQ: Cross-Device Analytics. (Please note that this feature is available only to Analytics Ultimate customers.) Cross-Device Analytics (CDA) transforms Adobe Analytics from a device centric to a person-centric analysis tool. Using CDA you can answer questions such as: <ul><li>How many people are interacting with my brand? How many and what types of devices do they use? How do they overlap?</li><li>How often do people begin a task on a mobile device and then later move to a desktop PC to complete the task? Do campaign click-throughs that land on one device lead to conversion somewhere else?</li><li>How does my understanding of campaign effectiveness change if I take into account cross-device journeys? How does my funnel analysis change?</li><li>What are the most common paths users take from one device to another? Where do they drop out? Where do they succeed?</li><li>How does the behavior of users with multiple devices differ from the users with a single device?</li></ul><br/>To learn more, visit [adobe.ly/aacda](https://spark.adobe.com/page/8ZpjsX6Lp5XTM/).|
|**Updated Classifications architecture**|Starting in September, an update to the Classifications architecture will be migrated to customers over a period of several months. The September release includes migration for a small number of early adopters.<br/>The update significantly reduces the time it takes for uploads (including rule logic) to be imported/ingested and made available for reporting.|

#### Fixes

* Fixed an issue with the [!UICONTROL People] and [!UICONTROL Offers] core services not being accessible from the main Experience Cloud menu. (AN-184294)
* Fixed an issue with the left rail in [!UICONTROL Analysis Workspace] oscillating between having a scrollbar and having no scrollbar, which caused a fluttering effect. (AN-183904)
* Fixed issues with error reporting. You will start to see more specific error messages instead of just the red error indicator. More specifically, it should help you understand when the issue is caused by heavy load, by an error , or by creating a report request that is too complex. (AN-184135) [More…](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/optimizing-performance.html)
* Fixed an issue that prevented the successful download of fallout reports in `.pdf/.xls/.rtf` formats. (AN-183165)
* Fixed issues with logging in through the Experience Cloud and switching to different Experience Cloud solutions or switching to another login company. (AN-183376)
* Fixed an issue with assets transfer of scheduled projects not working properly. Groups are managed in the [!UICONTROL Admin Console] now so we do not copy them between users when transferring assets anymore. (AN-183751)
* Fixed an issue with deleting scheduled reports whose owners have been deleted. From now on, a notification will go to the Admin (who performed the delete operation) when the schedule owner no longer exists. (AN-181000)

### Important notices for [!DNL Analytics] administrators {#aa-notices}

| Notice | Date Added or Updated  | Description |
| -----------| ---------- | ---------- |
| Update to Analysis Workspace Freeform Table totals | September 12, 2019 | In October 2019, freeform table total rows will begin accounting for [report filters](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/pagination-filtering-sorting.html) applied. To date, totals have accounted only for segmentation. With this change, dependent visualizations will update (e.g. linked [!UICONTROL Summary Number] visualizations), as well as exported CSV and PDF data.|
|Upcoming change regarding `createDate` field for Analytics users|August 30, 2019|In October or November 2019, the `createDate` field for Analytics users will be updated from US Pacific Time to a correctly formatted date/time value with time zone information. (AN-183468)|
| Support for Historical Timezone Offsets | August 8, 2019 | Analytics will now automatically handle timezone offsets for timestamped hits. Following this change on August 8, systems that load in data for historical processing will no longer need to adjust for timezone offsets before sending in the data. |
| Classification rule builder limits | Added June 5, 2019 | These limits are not new, but have been added to the documentation [here](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/components/classifications/classifications-rulebuilder/classification-rule-builder.html).|
| New segment operator limits | Added May 31, 2019 | Starting July 18, 2019, the segment operators _contains any of_, _does not contain any of_, _contains all of_ and _does not contain all_ of will be limited to 100 words per input field. The limit will be applied to all new and modified segments after this date. Existing segments that exceed the limit will continue to be supported, but cannot be modified or saved until the input field is reduced. These limits are being applied as part of a continued effort to improve query performance. |
| Support changes for **[!UICONTROL Date-Enabled]** and **[!UICONTROL Numeric 2 Classifications]** | Updated May 28, 2019 | The ability to import Numeric 2 and Date-Enabled classifications has been removed from the codebase. This change took effect with the July 2019 Maintenance Release. If you have Numeric or Date-Enabled columns in your import file, those cells will be silently ignored, and any other data within that file will be imported as normal. <br/>Existing classifications can still be exported through the standard classification workflow, and will continue to be available in reporting. |
| Change to _Report Total_ calculations | Updated July 9, 2019 | On **June 18, 2019**, Adobe Analytics made _Report Total_ calculations consistent across all dimensions and metrics. This resulted in a change to the totals for some reports (typically, Prop or Customer Attributes reports). Prior to this change, some Report Totals inconsistently included or excluded the _Unspecified_ line item in the total, regardless of whether _Unspecified_ appeared in the report. <br/>As of June 18, 2019, _Unspecified_ will always appear in the report total, even if it does not appear as a line item in the report. Additionally, segments using _exists_ or _does not exist_ logic may see different results for some dimensions after this change, specifically dimensions where _Unspecified_ has a special name such as the "Typed/Bookmarked" line item for Referrer Type dimension or the "Other" line item for the Device Type dimension. This change will affect Analysis Workspace, Reports & Analytics, Ad Hoc Analysis, Report Builder, and the Reporting API.<br>**Note**: This _Report Total_ calculation is now called _Grand Total_. See "Analysis Workspace: Update to Freeform table totals" in the [October 2019 release notes](/c-legacy-releases/2019/10102019.md). |
| Update to CSV downloads from Analysis Workspace | April 10, 2019 | Starting on April 11, 2019, several changes were made to **[!UICONTROL CSV downloads]** (and **[!UICONTROL Copy to Clipboard]**) from Analysis Workspace to remove formatting from exported data.  <ul><li>The thousands separator is no longer included. The decimal separator will continue to be included, and will adhere to the format defined under **[!UICONTROL Components > Report Settings > Thousands Separator]**. Note: Numeric values that use a comma as the decimal separator will continue to be quoted in the exported CSV.</li><li>No currency symbols will be shown.</li><li>No percent symbols will be shown. Percentages will be in decimal form. E.g., 75% will be represented as 0.75.</li><li>Time will be shown in seconds.</li><li>Cohort tables will show raw values only; percentages will be removed.</li><li>If a number is invalid, an empty cell will be displayed.</li></ul>|
| Upcoming change to the Analysis Workspace Debugger command | April 4, 2019 | The Console command to turn on the Analysis Workspace Debugger is changing to adobeTools.debug.includeOberonXml on **June 13, 2019**. adobe.tools.debug.includeOberonXml will cease to function after that date. |
| Mobile browser version numbers | February 7, 2019 | Starting January 8, 2019, we changed the truncation level for mobile browser version numbers from 2 to 1. From that date forward, versions only display the first two levels (e.g. _Firefox 64.0.2_ is now reported as _Firefox 64.0_). |
| End of life for [!DNL Ad Hoc Analysis] | January 29, 2019 | On August 6, 2018, Adobe announced the intention to end-of-life [!DNL Ad Hoc Analysis]. An end-of-life date will be shared once available.<br/>For more information, including which versions of Java will be compatible during this period, visit [[!DNL Discover Workspace]](https://adobe.ly/discoverworkspace). |
| Short [!DNL Analytics] report links | January 14, 2019 | Any short [!DNL Analytics] report links that have not been visited within one year will be cleaned up and deleted starting on Thursday, January 17, 2019, on a rolling schedule. |
| End of Support for TLS 1.0 | Updated January 10, 2019 | As of February 11, 2019 Adobe Analytics reporting no longer supports TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.0 encryption. This change is part of our ongoing efforts to maintain the highest security standards and promote the safety of customer data. If you are unable to connect to Adobe Analytics reporting after February 11, 2019, you should upgrade your browser to the [latest version](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/admin/admin-tools/server-side-forwarding/ssf-requirements.html).<br/> As of February 20, 2019 Adobe Analytics data collection no longer supports TLS 1.0. With this change, Adobe no longer collects [!DNL Analytics] data from end users with older devices or web browsers that do not support TLS 1.1 or later. We do not expect this to have a significant impact on customer data or reporting. (If your website already does not support TLS 1.0, you will not be affected.) <br/>Beginning April 11, 2019, the Adobe Analytics Reporting API no longer supports TLS 1.0 encryption. Customers who access the API should verify that they will not be impacted. <ul><li>API clients using Java 7 with default settings will need [modifications to support TLS 1.2](https://www.java.com/en/configure_crypto.html). (Refer to _Changing default TLS protocol version for client end points: TLS 1.0 to TLS 1.2_.) </li><li>API clients using Java 8 should not be impacted, because the default setting is TLS 1.2.</li><li> API clients using other frameworks will need to contact their vendors for details on TLS 1.2 support.</li></ul>|
| Data Feed: post_product_list column - size change | January 9, 2019 | On February 7, 2019, Adobe expanded the size of the post_product_list column from 64 KB to 16 MB. This change ensures that merchandising eVar values added to post_product_list during processing do not cause truncation of product and revenue values. If you have processes that ingest post_product_list values, please ensure those processes can handle values up to 16 MB in length, or will truncate the value at 16 KB to avoid data ingestion failures. |
| Management changes affecting inactive [!DNL Analytics Live Stream] endpoints | December 20, 2018 | Starting on February 1, 2019, [!DNL Live Stream] endpoints with no active consumer connections for 90 days may be disabled. You can reach out to Customer Care to inquire about your [!DNL Live Stream] endpoints and, if necessary, have them re-enabled. In addition, please ensure your consumer processes maintain a persistent connection, as intended by the design of the service, and that they are implemented to reconnect when the connection is disconnected or interrupted. |
| Update Adobe [!DNL Report Builder] due to end of support for TLS 1.0 | Sept. 7, 2018 | Due to the end of support for TLS 1.0, we recommended that [!DNL Report Builder] users download version v5.6.21 prior to February 2019. After that date, prior versions of [!DNL Report Builder] will no longer function. |

|**[Configuring Twitter Tailored Audiences as a Self-Service Device-Based Destination](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/audience-manager/user-guide/features/destinations/device-based/twitter-tailored-audiences.html)**|We're migrating Twitter destinations to a self-service configuration model. This article explains what you need to do for existing Twitter integrations to continue working after the migration.|

**Fixes and Improvements**

* We fixed a bug where users were unable to edit Adobe Analytics destinations to map segments manually. (AAM-49323)
* We fixed a bug where duplicate Audience Marketplace feeds were originating from a single data source ID. There must be a 1:1 mapping between data sources and [!DNL Marketplace] feeds. (AAM-48504)
* We made an enhancement to the trait and segment creation workflow. Now, you can filter the data source to store the trait or segment, to exclude any non-Audience Manager data sources (for example, report suite data sources from Adobe Analytics). (AAM-35899)
* We fixed an issue in the Data Sources API where setting the query parameter `ExcludeReportSuites=true` did not exclude report suite data sources from Adobe Analytics. (AAM-48545)
* We made several improvements related to the accessibility of the Audience Manager User Interface. (AAM-49024) and (AAM-49031)

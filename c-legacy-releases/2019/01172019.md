## [!DNL Analytics] {#analytics}

Release date: **January 17, 2019**

New features and fixes in [!DNL Adobe Analytics]:

* [Analysis Workspace](#aa-wksp)
* [Important notices for Analytics administrators](#aa-notices)

For product documentation, see [Analytics Help Home](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/).

### [!UICONTROL Analysis Workspace] {#aa-wksp}

Features and fixes in [!UICONTROL Analysis Workspace].

#### [!UICONTROL Cohort Analysis]

Major improvements to [!UICONTROL Cohort Analysis] let you:

* Apply a segment inclusion and return metrics separately.
* Show churn instead of retention.
* Show latency tables (time elapsed before and after an inclusion event).
* Customize cohort dimension (to group visitors based on an eVar, not just time).
* Rolling cohort calculation: calculate retention and churn based on prior time period, not original cohort.
* Add in multiple metrics in inclusion and return fields, as well as apply segments. (Calculated metrics are not supported.)

#### [!UICONTROL View Density]

This new setting lets you see more data on a single screen by reducing the vertical padding of the left rail, in freeform tables, and in cohort tables.

This setting is accessible via **[!UICONTROL Project]** > **[!UICONTROL Project Info & Settings]**.

#### Support for multi-valued variables in Attribution IQ

Some dimensions in Analytics can contain multiple values on a single hit, such as listVars, the product variable, list props, or merchandising eVars. Analysis Workspace lets you apply Attribution IQ to any of these types of variables at the hit level.

#### [!UICONTROL Marketing Channels] enhancements

We now expose the AMO ID and AMO EF ID to the marketing channels processing rule. These are the primary and secondary tracking codes used by the [!DNL Advertising Cloud] and [!UICONTROL Advertising Analytics] integrations.

#### Performance improvements

Speed improvements to breakdown visualizations. For example, projects with multiple breakdowns load faster.

#### Fixes in [!UICONTROL Analysis Workspace]

* Fixed an issue where internal segment definitions created by dropping components into the panel drop zone did not persist across sessions. (AN-172110)
* Fixed an issue with edits to visualization labels not getting saved. (AN-171119, AN-170287, AN-169721)
* Fixed performance issues with [!UICONTROL Analysis Workspace], especially with projects containing multiple line visualizations. (AN-169916, AN-169691, AN-167120, AN-168082)
* Fixed an issue with the **[!UICONTROL Try in Workspace]** option in [!UICONTROL Reports & Analytics]: segments got dropped and did not appear in the corresponding Workspace project. (AN-169491)
* Fixed an issue with calculated metrics returning errors when there were multiple date ranges on the project. (AN-169057)
* Fixed an issue with breakdown data not updating when the topmost table was collapsed and the date range was changed. (AN-168695)

#### Other Analytics fixes

* Admin: Fixed an issue that prevented non-admins from being able to create processing rules, even though they were assigned the proper rights. (AN-170690)
* Admin: Fixed an issue with being unable to adjust the number of allocated scheduled Report Builder reports a user can run. (AN-168949)
* Admin: Fixed an issue that occurred when creating a new report suite based on another report suite. Some unexpected settings were copied. (AN-172395)
* Admin: Fixed an issue that prevented users from downloading the template report suite settings. (AN-171092)
* Fixed performance issues with logging in to Analytics via the Experience Cloud. (AN-169254)
* Fixed an issue with the search function in Reports & Analytics not working properly. (AN-170354)
* Fixed an issue with the Mobile Device ID dimension, which resulted in permissions errors. (AN-169728)

* Fixed an issue with the phone number request in the traffic spike request UI. The phone number field has been removed. (AN-170992)
* Fixed an issue that caused users to be redirected to the wrong URL after logging out of the Admin Console. They are now being redirected to the Admin Console login. (AN-167880)
* Fixed an issue that prevented users from saving changes to Virtual Report Suites that were tied to deleted segments. (AN-168906)
* Fixed an issue that caused participation metrics to cease working with list variables in Ad Hoc Analysis. (AN-166027)

### Important notices for [!DNL Analytics] administrators {#aa-notices}

| Notice | Date Added or Updated  | Description |
| -----------| ---------- | ---------- |
| Short Analytics report links | January 14, 2019 | Any short Analytics report links that have not been visited within one year will be cleaned up and deleted starting on Thursday, January 17, 2019, on a rolling schedule. |
| End of Support for TLS 1.0 | Updated January 10, 2019 | On February 11, 2019 Adobe Analytics reporting will no longer support TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.0 encryption. This change is part of our ongoing efforts to maintain the highest security standards and promote the safety of customer data. If you are unable to connect to Adobe Analytics reporting after February11, 2019, you should upgrade your browser to the [latest version](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/user/requirements.html). Beginning February 20, 2019 Adobe Analytics data collection will no longer support TLS 1.0. With this change, Adobe will no longer collect Analytics data from end users with older devices or web browsers that do not support TLS 1.1 or later. We do not expect this to have a significant impact on customer data or reporting. (If your website already does not support TLS 1.0, you will not be affected.) <br/>Beginning April 11, 2019, the Adobe Analytics Reporting API will no longer support TLS 1.0 encryption. Customers who access the API should verify that they will not be impacted. API clients using Java 7 with default settings will need modifications to support TLS 1.2. (Refer to Changing default TLS protocol version for client end points: TLS 1.0 to TLS 1.2.) API clients using Java 8 should not be impacted because the default setting is TLS 1.2. API clients using other frameworks will need to contact their vendors for details on TLS 1.2 support.|
| Update to CSV downloads from Analysis Workspace | January 9, 2019 | Starting on February 7, 2019, CSV downloads (and Copy to Clipboard) from Analysis Workspace will no longer include the thousands separator. Note: The Analysis Workspace UI will continue to show the thousands separator. Additionally, the decimal separator will continue to be included, and will adhere to the format defined under **[!UICONTROL Components]** > **[!UICONTROL Report Settings]** > **[!UICONTROL Thousands Separator]**. |
| Data Feed: post_product_list column - size change | January 9, 2019 | On February 7, 2019, Adobe plans to expand the size of the post_product_list column from 64 KB to 16 MB. This change is intended to ensure that merchandising eVar values added to post_product_list during processing do not cause truncation of product and revenue values. If you have processes that ingest post_product_list values, please ensure those processes can handle values up to 16 MB in length, or will truncate the value at 16 KB to avoid data ingestion failures. |
| Management changes affecting inactive Analytics Live Stream endpoints | December 20, 2018 | Starting on February 1, 2019, Live Stream endpoints with no active consumer connections for 90 days may be disabled. You can reach out to Customer Care to inquire about your Live Stream endpoints and, if necessary, have them re-enabled. In addition, please ensure your consumer processes maintain a persistent connection, as intended by the design of the service, and that they are implemented to reconnect when the connection is disconnected or interrupted. |
| Dallas FTP server migration (ftp2.omniture.com) | October 19, 2018 | On October 23, 2018, if you connect to ftp2.omniture.com via the SFTP protocol, you might be required to re-accept the SJ1 site's host identifier. This issue applies only to October 23. See [Upgrading Adobe FTP Servers](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/whitepapers/ftp/ftp_upgrade.html). |
| Update to Mobile Device dimension | October 16, 2018 | On September 26, Adobe updated its device lookup to Device Atlas's 2.1 API. This caused more detailed devices (e.g. Apple iPhone 7, Apple iPhone 8 Plus, etc.) to appear in the Mobile Device dimension for some browsers. This new level of device detail should be used directionally as is does not extend to all devices and browser types at this time. |
| End of support for Internet Explorer 11 | Sept. 12, 2018 | Adobe will end support for Internet Explorer 11 within Adobe Analytics on November 13, 2018. Please switch to Microsoft Edge or another supported browser as soon as possible. |
| End of life for Ad Hoc Analysis | August 9, 2018 | On August 6, 2018, Adobe announced the intention to end-of-life Ad Hoc Analysis. An end-of-life date will be shared once available. For more information, visit [Discover Workspace](https://spark.adobe.com/page/S9Bhp66VJ2fEn/). We will not modify [!UICONTROL Ad Hoc Analysis] to support Java 9+ from this point forward. If you upgrade to Java 9+, [!UICONTROL Ad Hoc Analysis] will cease to function. Only Java 8 will be supported. |
| Update Adobe [!UICONTROL Report Builder] due to end of support for TLS 1.0 | Sept. 7, 2018 | Due to the end of support for TLS 1.0, we recommended that [!UICONTROL Report Builder] (ARB) users download ARB v5.6.21 prior to February 2019. After that date, prior versions of ARB will no longer function. |
| New help for the Analytics user migration | May 10, 2018 | We updated the Analytics user ID migration help with information about migrating Enterprise and Federated IDs to the Admin Console. See [Migrate Analytics user accounts for Enterprise and Federated IDs](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/experience-cloud/admin-console/analytics-migration/migrate-enterprise.html). |
| Upcoming removal of Account Activity Report | May 10, 2018 | The Account Activity Report will be replaced by the Server Call Usage feature in the Adobe Analytics Summer Release. The Account Activity Report will be permanently removed on August 9, 2018. To view summary data about report suite traffic after August 9, 2018, use the Server Call Usage feature. |
| Changes to linear allocation models in Calculated Metrics | Effective July 19, 2018 | On July 19th, Adobe Analytics will revise the way allocation models in calculated metrics are evaluated. As part of this change, calculated metrics that use a non-default allocation model will be migrated to new and improved attribution models. [!UICONTROL Marketing Channel Last Touch] and [!UICONTROL Marketing Channel First Touch] allocation models will be migrated to new [!UICONTROL Last Touch] and [!UICONTROL First Touch] attribution models  espectively. ([!UICONTROL Marketing Channels] are not being deprecated, only the two allocation models that appear in calculated metrics). Additionally, we will correct the way linear allocation is calculated. If you use calculated metrics with linear allocation models, the reports may change slightly to reflect the new, corrected attribution model. This change to calculated metrics will be reflected in [!UICONTROL Analysis Workspace], [!UICONTROL Reports & Analytics], the [!UICONTROL Reporting API], [!UICONTROL Report Builder], and [!UICONTROL Ad Hoc Analysis]. See the [Calculated Metrics](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/analytics/calcmetrics/m_metric_type_alloc.html) documentation for more information about this change. |
| [!UICONTROL Anomaly Detection] and [!UICONTROL Contribution Analysis] functionality removed from [!UICONTROL Reports & Analytics] | April 10, 2018 | Anomaly Detection and Contribution Analysis have been removed from the Reports & Analytics feature set and are now available only via Analysis Workspace. Adobe Analytics Select and Foundation customers have access only to “daily-granularity” Anomaly Detection in Workspace. |
| Adobe no longer issuing 3rd-party s_vi cookies for Safari | April 05, 2018 | On March 20, 2018, Adobe stopped issuing third-party s_vi cookies for the Safari browser. This change does not impact customers using first-party data collection cookies. This change also removes the visit and visitor inflation experienced by some customers, resulting from Safari ITP. |
| Update Report Builder before you migrate user IDs to the Admin Console | March 17, 2018 | **Important:** Update your installation of Report Builder to the latest version. This update is a pre-requisite for running the Analytics user ID migration to the Admin Console, beginning in April 2018. See [Analytics User Migration to the Admin Console] for migration information. |
| Back-end changes that affect reporting | April 11, 2018 | A change to the (back-end) lookup mechanism is going to impact reporting in several ways. Please be aware that these changes went into effect around the end of February, 2018: Page renaming will no longer be allowed. Going forward, you will need to use classifications to rename pages. Until the May 10, 2018 release, the system will continue to process the renamed pages as they are currently configured. Adobe is asking all customers to migrate to classifications by that date. After the May release, existing renames will no longer be honored and can change, retroactively, without notice. <br/>The URL replacement methodology is different. Previously, Adobe Analytics would store (mostly) the first URL associated with each page name each month. Going forward, we will store the most recent URL for each page name. (Updated April 11, 2018) Category reports for roll-ups and current data in Reports & Analytics are no longer provided. Deprecating category roll-up reports in the Web Service API is effective with the May 10, 2018, Adobe Analytics maintenance release. There is no longer any support for page/prop data from before approximately January 2007 (in some cases, 2006). This only impacts pages, props and page events (i.e. custom links, exit links, download links). Note: This change does not impact reporting in Analysis Workspace or Data Warehouse. If you have data preceding these dates, expect the following: Data will not combine correctly across the pre/post January 2007 boundary. Searches will not work against data before approximately Jan. 2007. |
| Upcoming support changes for Date-Enabled and Numeric Classifications | May 7, 2018 | In the May 10, 2018 Maintenance release, we will begin limiting the functionality of date-enabled and numeric classifications. These classification types will be removed from the Admin and Classification Importer interfaces. From that date on, no new date-enabled and numeric classifications can be added. Existing classifications can still be managed (uploaded to, deleted) through the standard classification workflow, and will continue to be available in reporting. |
| Upcoming support changes for Marketing Channel Cost and Budget | February 28, 2018 | In the April maintenance release, we will remove Marketing Channel Cost and Budget from the Admin > Marketing Channel menu. No new cost and budget data can be added. Existing cost and budget data will continue to be available in reporting, but cannot be updated. |
| Code Manager - Legacy H Code | February 8, 2018 | Downloading legacy JavaScript (H code) from the Code Manager is no longer supported. |
| Data retention: Check and set your data retention policy for Adobe Analytics | February 1, 2018 | **Background:** The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which applies as from May 25, 2018, provides that Adobe, in its role as your data processor, must take appropriate measures to assist its customers in fulfilling access, deletion, and other requests from individuals. Applying appropriate, secure, and timely deletion policies is an important part of complying with this obligation. As a result, Adobe would like to work with you to implement a data retention policy before GDPR takes effect on May 25, 2018.<br/>**What to expect:** Unless you already have an Adobe Analytics data retention policy in place, Adobe will begin applying data retention as currently specified in customer contracts for Adobe Analytics, unless other arrangements are made. Most Adobe Analytics contracts state that Adobe may delete data after 25 months. Once a data retention policy is in place for your organization, it is enforced on a rolling monthly basis. Data retention for longer periods than 25 months is available for an additional fee. Data retention periods for shorter periods can also be configured by contacting Customer Care. You will soon receive an email with additional details for your organization. <br/>Data retention impacts all methods for accessing historical Adobe Analytics data, including but not limited to Reports & Analytics, Analysis Workspace, Report Builder, the Web Services Reporting APIs, data warehouse, and data feeds. **Next steps:** Identify stakeholders within your organization responsible for making decisions about data retention. Your organization is best placed to know the appropriate period for which Adobe Analytics data should be retained. Contact your Adobe Customer Success Manager if you have questions regarding data retention for Adobe Analytics. |
| User account linking | October 26, 2017 | Analytics users no longer need to manually link their accounts between the Experience Cloud and Analytics. Users can contact their Admin Console administrator to request Analytics access. The Analytics user ID migration enables administrators to easily migrate user accounts from Analytics User Management to the Adobe Admin Console. After your users are migrated, they will have access to the purchased solutions and core services available in the Experience Cloud. [Learn more about the Analytics User ID Migration](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/experience-cloud/admin-console/analytics-migration/). |

## [!DNL Campaign] {#ac}

[!DNL Adobe Campaign] provides an intuitive, automated way to deliver one-to-one messages across online and offline marketing channels. You can now anticipate what your clients want using experiences determined by their habits and preferences.

| Feature    | Description  |

| Email Designer General Availability  | The new intuitive Email Designer (formerly known as Creative Designer) is now generally available. It supports all the features from the legacy content editor, including: The use of dynamic images from Adobe Target; The ability to retrieve content from a URL automatically at preparation time; Fully compliant out-of-the box content templates. For more information, see Email Content Design and the feature video. As a consequence, the legacy email content editor is now deprecated. For more information, see Deprecated and Removed Features in Campaign Standard. |  
| Product Listings in Transactional Emails  | You can now reference one or more data collections in a transactional email message to create loops on specific content. For example, you can automatically send a cart abandonment email listing all the products that were in the user's cart with an image, the price, and a link to each product. For more information, refer to the product documentation and feature video. |
| Mobile View in the Email Designer  | You can now switch to a dedicated mobile view when editing email content.

## [!DNL Advertising Cloud] {#adcloud}

New features in [!DNL Adobe Advertising Cloud].

### Portfolios

(Beta) A new "Weekly" spend strategy allows you to maximize weighted revenue while trying to spend a specified weekly amount. This strategy automatically uses day-of-week models and simulations.

If you want to use this strategy for a portfolio, wait until the portfolio has been optimized for at least two weeks, and then actively monitor spending and performance until the feature is validated.

You can now allow Google Ads to optimize multiple campaigns to a single return on ad spend (ROAS) or cost per acquisition (CPA) target using the new Advertising Cloud spend strategies "Google Target CPA" and "Google Target ROAS." With these spend strategies, all assigned Google Ads campaigns will have the specified bid strategy and the specified target; campaigns on other search engines are ignored. All other portfolio settings are disabled.

In the portfolio section "Auto-optimize Bid Adjustment Values," the "Audience Target" option now optimizes Google Ads remarketing list, customer match, and similar audiences (which you can create within Google Ads) at the campaign and ad group levels. Previously, a "Remarketing List" option optimized only remarketing lists at the ad group level.

For portfolios with learning enabled, Advertising Cloud can now automatically bid up bid units with zero impressions within the specified learning budget.

By default, you can use the legacy manual rules for bidding up bid units with zero impressions until the manual option is deprecated. In this case, the learning budget applies only to bid units with models, and zero impression learning uses additional spend. The portfolio may spend more than the allotted learning budget to meet the specified parameters.

### Search Campaigns

The Campaigns (Legacy) views are no longer in the main menu. To use the legacy views, which will be deprecated in February, go to Search > Campaigns > Campaigns, scroll to the bottom right of the page, and click Legacy Campaigns.

If you're in the legacy views, you can return to the new views by either opening Search > Campaigns > Campaigns from the main menu or by scrolling to the right and clicking Click here to try our new Campaigns experience.

(Yandex accounts only) When the account is managed by an agency/management account, you can now specify the management account using the "MCC Account" field. To remove an existing association, select "No MCC Account."

(Google Ads) You can now create responsive search ads, which are in beta mode within Google Ads, for campaigns on the search and display networks. Google Ads dynamically assembles text-based responsive search ads from a set of ad titles and descriptions, favoring combinations that perform well together. You can optionally pin ad titles and descriptions to specific positions. Reporting is at the ad level.

Bulksheet support for managing responsive search ads will be available in a future release. Data about campaign assignment to portfolios is now included in the portfolio change history, which is available from the Portfolios view. When you compare data for two date ranges, you can now sort the data by the comparison column (such as Impressions R2).

Error messages now have an option to report the issue. Session data is automatically included with the report, and you can optionally enter text details.

### Search Constraints Beta

(Google Ads and Bing Ads accounts only; beta feature) You can now constrain bids according to their impression share.

### Social Beta

### Integration with [!DNL Analytics]

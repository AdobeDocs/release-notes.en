### New features and fixes in Adobe Analytics {#aa-features} 

| Feature/Enhancement    | Description  |
| -----------| ---------- |  
| **Segmentation** | New attribution models for dimensions in segmentation:<ul><li>Repeating (Default): Includes instances + persisted values for the dimension.</li><li>Instance: Includes instances for the dimension.</li><li>Non-repeating instance: Includes unique instances (non-repeating) for the dimension.</li></ul> [More](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/components/segmentation/segmentation-workflow/seg-build.html) |
| **Segmentation** | New segment operators: **[!UICONTROL Equals Any of]** and **[!UICONTROL Does not Equal Any of]**. [More...](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/components/segmentation/segment-reference/seg-operators.html) |
| **Debugger** | When logged in with your Adobe ID, you now have the option to retrieve post-processed hits in the Experience Cloud Debugger. Post-processed hits are server calls after they have gone through [!UICONTROL Processing Rules] and VISTA Rules, letting you validate [!UICONTROL Processing Rules] and your VISTA rules. **Note**: If you are using A4T (SupplementalDataID) the post-processing data will can take a few minutes to come back. |
| **Analysis Workspace:** | Added new out-of-the-box filters to the left rail search. Beyond what you see today (Dimensions, Metrics, Approved, etc.), new filters such as Calculated Metrics, Customer Attributes, eVars, Props, Video, etc. were added to make it easier to find the components you need. | 
| **Analysis Workspace** |  We have added a warning to the Fallout visualization that will display when you add a segment as a touchpoint - certain invalid segment container combinations will lead to invalid Fallout diagrams, such as <ul><li>Using a visitor-based segment as a touchpoint inside a visitor-context Fallout visualization</li><li>Using a visitor-based segment as a touchpoint inside a visit-context Fallout visualization</li><li>Using a visit-based segment as a touchpoint inside a visit-context Fallout visualization</li></ul> <br> [More...](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/fallout/compare-segments-fallout.html) </br>|
| **Analytics Documentation Improvements** | Analytics documentation has been reorganized and now includes collaboration features that let you improve the content! You can log issues against the documentation and suggest edits. The doc set has moved to a [new domain](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/landing/home.html). Redirects should be in place. |
| **New Tech Notes User Guide** |  The [Tech Notes user guide](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/technotes/home.html) is now available. Currently, it is geared towards helping users more experienced with third-party analytics tools, such as Google Analytics, to become more familiar with Adobe Analytics. The tech notes user guide will expand over the coming months to include additional content. | 

**Analysis Workspace Fixes**

* Fixed an issue with localized Japanese date information in [!DNL Analysis Workspace] visualizations. (AN-180114)
* Fixed an issue that occurred after copying and pasting dimension items. Subsequent searches on the item resulted in an error. (AN-177394)
* Fixed an issue with the edit option missing in segment panels within freeform tables. (AN-171703)
* Fixed an issue with **[!UICONTROL Set as Landing Page]** feature not working when shared with a large set of recipients. (AN-163922)
* Fixed an issue where strings got vertically clipped in Real-time reports. (AN-175980)

**Other Analytics Fixes**

* Fixed an issue with Admin users being unable to enable **[!UICONTROL Success Events]**. (AN-176689)
* Fixed an issue that occurred when creating an alert with the **[!UICONTROL Exit Rate]** metric. (AN-177476)

### Important notices for Analytics administrators {#aa-notices}

| Notice | Date Added or Updated  | Description |
| -----------| ---------- | ---------- |
| Data Collection update | Added June 27, 2019 | All Adobe Analytics cookies with the “same-site-by-default-cookies” flag now have this flag set to `SameSite=None`. |
| Audit Log UI changes | Updated June 25, 2019 | In the API `Logs.GetUsageLog`, the following changes were made to the UI: <ul><li>The response headers in the API were changed: a) from `timestamp` to `dateCreated`, b) from `login` to `companyLogin`, c) from `event_num` to `eventType`, d) from `event_type` to `event_type`, e) from `ip_address` to `ipAddress`, f) from `report_suite` to `rsid`, g) from `event_details` to `logText`. </li><li>The timestamp format changed from Unix timestamp to ISO 8601 time</li></ul><br>In the API as well as the Admin log UI, the audit logs results now contain report suite ID instead of report suite name. |
| Classification rule builder limits | Added June 5, 2019 | These limits are not new, but have been added to the documentation [here](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/classification_rule_builder.html).|
| New segment operator limits | Added May 31, 2019 | Starting on July 18, 2019, the segment operators "contains any of", "does not contain any of", "contains all of" and "does not contain all of" will be limited to 100 words per input field. The limit will be applied to all new and modified segments after this date. Existing segments that exceed the limit will continue to be supported, but cannot be modified or saved until the input field is reduced. These limits are being applied as part of a continued effort to improve query performance. |
| Upcoming support changes for **[!UICONTROL Date-Enabled]** and **[!UICONTROL Numeric 2 Classifications]** | Updated May 28, 2019 | The ability to import Numeric 2 and Date-Enabled classifications has been removed from the codebase. This change will take effect with the July 2019 Maintenance Release. If you have Numeric or Date-Enabled columns in your import file, those cells will be silently ignored, and any other data within that file will be imported as normal. <br/>Existing classifications can still be exported through the standard classification workflow, and will continue to be available in reporting. |
| Upcoming change to _Report Total_ calculations | Updated May 2, 2019 | On **June 13, 2019**, Adobe Analytics will make _Report Total_ calculations consistent across all dimensions and metrics. This will result in a change to the totals for some reports (typically, Prop or Customer Attributes reports). Prior to this change, some Report Totals inconsistently included or excluded the _Unspecified_ line item in the total, regardless of whether _Unspecified_ appeared in the report. <br/>As of June 13, 2019, _Unspecified_ will always appear in the report total, even if it does not appear as a line item in the report. Additionally, segments using _exists_ or _does not exist_ logic may see different results for some dimensions after this change. This change will affect Analysis Workspace, Reports & Analytics, Ad Hoc Analysis, Report Builder, and the Reporting API. |
| Update to CSV downloads from [!DNL Analysis Workspace]| April 10, 2019 | Starting on April 11, 2019, several changes were made to **[!UICONTROL CSV downloads]** (and **[!UICONTROL Copy to Clipboard]**) from [!DNL Analysis Workspace] to remove formatting from exported data.  <ul><li>The thousands separator is no longer included. The decimal separator will continue to be included, and will adhere to the format defined under **[!UICONTROL Components > Report Settings > Thousands Separator]**. Note: Numeric values that use a comma as the decimal separator will continue to be quoted in the exported CSV.</li><li>No currency symbols will be shown.</li><li>No percent symbols will be shown. Percentages will be in decimal form. E.g., 75% will be represented as 0.75.</li><li>Time will be shown in seconds.</li><li>Cohort tables will show raw values only; percentages will be removed.</li><li>If a number is invalid, an empty cell will be displayed.</li></ul>|
| Upcoming change to the [!DNL Analysis Workspace] Debugger command | April 4, 2019 | The Console command to turn on the [!DNL Analysis Workspace] Debugger is changing to adobeTools.debug.includeOberonXml on **June 13, 2019**. adobe.tools.debug.includeOberonXml will cease to function after that date. |
| Mobile browser version numbers | February 7, 2019 | Starting January 8, 2019, we changed the truncation level for mobile browser version numbers from 2 to 1. From that date forward, versions only display the first two levels (e.g. _Firefox 64.0.2_ is now reported as _Firefox 64.0_). |
| End of life for [!DNL Ad Hoc Analysis] | January 29, 2019 | On August 6, 2018, Adobe announced the intention to end-of-life [!DNL Ad Hoc Analysis]. An end-of-life date will be shared once available.<br/>For more information, including which versions of Java will be compatible during this period, visit [Discover Workspace](https://adobe.ly/discoverworkspace). |
| Short Analytics report links | January 14, 2019 | Any short Analytics report links that have not been visited within one year will be cleaned up and deleted starting on Thursday, January 17, 2019, on a rolling schedule. |
| End of Support for TLS 1.0 | Updated January 10, 2019 | As of February 11, 2019 Adobe Analytics reporting no longer supports TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.0 encryption. This change is part of our ongoing efforts to maintain the highest security standards and promote the safety of customer data. If you are unable to connect to Adobe Analytics reporting after February 11, 2019, you should upgrade your browser to the [latest version](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/user/requirements.html).<br/> As of February 20, 2019 Adobe Analytics data collection no longer supports TLS 1.0. With this change, Adobe no longer collects Analytics data from end users with older devices or web browsers that do not support TLS 1.1 or later. We do not expect this to have a significant impact on customer data or reporting. (If your website already does not support TLS 1.0, you will not be affected.) <br/>Beginning April 11, 2019, the Adobe Analytics Reporting API no longer supports TLS 1.0 encryption. Customers who access the API should verify that they will not be impacted. <ul><li>API clients using Java 7 with default settings will need [modifications to support TLS 1.2](https://www.java.com/en/configure_crypto.html). (Refer to _Changing default TLS protocol version for client end points: TLS 1.0 to TLS 1.2_.) </li><li>API clients using Java 8 should not be impacted, because the default setting is TLS 1.2.</li><li> API clients using other frameworks will need to contact their vendors for details on TLS 1.2 support.</li></ul>|
| Data Feed: post_product_list column - size change | January 9, 2019 | On February 7, 2019, Adobe expanded the size of the post_product_list column from 64 KB to 16 MB. This change ensures that merchandising eVar values added to post_product_list during processing do not cause truncation of product and revenue values. If you have processes that ingest post_product_list values, please ensure those processes can handle values up to 16 MB in length, or will truncate the value at 16 KB to avoid data ingestion failures. |
| Management changes affecting inactive [!DNL Analytics Live Stream] endpoints | December 20, 2018 | Starting on February 1, 2019, [!DNL Live Stream] endpoints with no active consumer connections for 90 days may be disabled. You can reach out to Customer Care to inquire about your [!DNL Live Stream] endpoints and, if necessary, have them re-enabled. In addition, please ensure your consumer processes maintain a persistent connection, as intended by the design of the service, and that they are implemented to reconnect when the connection is disconnected or interrupted. |
| Update Adobe [!DNL Report Builder] due to end of support for TLS 1.0 | Sept. 7, 2018 | Due to the end of support for TLS 1.0, we recommended that [!DNL Report Builder] users download version v5.6.21 prior to February 2019. After that date, prior versions of [!DNL Report Builder] will no longer function. |

### New Features in Adobe Analytics {#aa-features}

| Feature    | Description  |
| -----------| ---------- |  
| Changes to Regional Data Collection  | To improve data collection performance, all remaining customers have been converted to Regional Data Collection (RDC) so that collection occurs as close to your end users as possible. This improves the site/app performance and ensures that data is collected as quickly as possible to optimize the end user experience.<br/> Once data from your digital properties is collected regionally, it is forwarded over a secure connection to a Data Processing Center, where it is processed and made available to products in the Adobe Experience Cloud. RDC has been the default for new implementations for 10+ years. [More](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/regional-data-collection.html)|  
|Changes to RDC in China  | Adobe's Regional Data Collection in mainland China enables customers within China to send data directly to a Data Collection Center within China, instead of other locations globally. This improves page load times and data accuracy compared with sending the data to Data Collection Centers outside of China. [More](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/rdc-china.html) |
| Regional acceleration for China  | The China Acceleration option is now available in Analytics Report Suite Settings. This option improves the Adobe Analytics Reporting user experience for users in Mainland China. Each Adobe Analytics user can enable or disable this option. Do not select this option for users outside Mainland China as it will negatively affect performance. [More](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/user/report_settings.html) |
| New Livestream variables  | * **carrier**: The wireless provider for the mobile device. <br/>* **tnt:** The test-and-target field used in Target. The _actionId_ and _actionName_ never have values.<br/>* **tntAction:** The enhanced test-and-target field used in Target. Unlike the tnt field, the _actionId_ and _actionName_ have values set.|
| API 2.0: Support for JWT authentication  | The Adobe Analytics 2.0 API now supports JWT authentication. More information about JWT Authentication can be found here: [https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-2.0-apis/blob/master/jwt.md](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-2.0-apis/blob/master/jwt.md) |

### Media Analytics SDK 2.2 for: Chromecast, Roku, Apple TV, and [!DNL Launch] Web Extension {#aa-va}

| Feature    | Description  |
| -----------| ---------- |
| Adobe Analytics for Audio  | Connects a listener's streaming audio engagement with their full digital behavior. You can understand who's listening where, when, and how often, and evaluate user behavior in a commonly fragmented audio marketplace. <br/> This feature enables businesses to measure the reach of their listeners, measure the popularity of their content, and provides insight into how to keep users engaged based on their behaviors and look-alike modeling. Measure 10-second audio content and 1-second streaming ads with our best-in-class SDKs, to evaluate both quality of experience (stall, errors, time to start) and content plus ad KPIs. |  
| Maintaining Ad Breaks  | Enhanced Ad tracking in scenarios where if a player has entered an ad break, and no calls are sent for a certain period of time, the SDK logic defaults to content playback, even if the player is still in an ad-break state. During a pre-roll ad, this might result in a content-start firing before the ad break is complete. In Media 2.2 SDK, buffer calls are sent between ads within an ad break when there is a long delay between ads. |
| SDK Name Change  | Starting with the 2.2 release, the Video Heartbeat Library (VHL) SDKs are renamed to Media SDK. The Media 2.2 SDK is fully backwards compatible with the VHL 2.X SDK series. The name change does not represent a functional break, simply a change in naming convention. |

### Analytics - Fixes and Updates

Fixes and minor updates applied to Adobe Analytics interface tools and components (Analysis Workspace, Reports & Analytics, Report Builder, and so on).

* **Analysis Workspace:** Fixed an issue that prevented any data from showing in the Map visualization. (AN-170626)
* Fixed an issue where a (migrated) user’s first/last name in Analytics was different than the name linked to the user’s Adobe ID in Experience Cloud. To update the Analytics name with the one in Experience Cloud, go to **[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL User Management (Legacy)]** > **[!UICONTROL Edit Users]** and click the User ID. Then click **[!UICONTROL Update from Experience Cloud]**. (AN-172825)
* Fixed an issue with the display of web services permissions where the UI implied that a user had permissions when, in reality, they did not. (AN-168076)

### Important notices for Analytics administrators {#aa-notices}

| Notice | Date Added or Updated  | Description |
| -----------| ---------- | ---------- |
| Upcoming support changes for Date-Enabled and Numeric Classifications | February 28, 2019 | The ability to import Numeric 2 and Date-Enabled classifications has been removed from the codebase. This change will take effect with the June 2019 Maintenance Release. If you have Numeric or Date-Enabled columns in your import file, those cells will be silently ignored, and any other data within that file will be imported as normal. <br/>Existing classifications can still be exported through the standard classification workflow, and will continue to be available in reporting. |
| Significantly updated the documentation on the getPercentPageViewed plug-in. | February 12, 2019 | [https://experiencecloud.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/implement/getPercentPageViewed.html](https://experiencecloud.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/implement/getPercentPageViewed.html) |
| Admin > General Account Settings |  February 7, 2019| * The setting _Replace the last octet of IP addresses with 0_ is enabled by default for any new report suites created in the London Data Center after January 2019, but only if the settings for those report suites are copied from a template listed in the Admin Console. Report suites whose settings are duplicated from other report suites inherit all settings from the selected report suite.<br/> * The setting _IP Obfuscation_ is no longer enabled by default for all customers with a report suite set in EMEA. |
| Mobile browser version numbers | February 7, 2019 | Starting January 8, 2019, we changed the truncation level for mobile browser version numbers from 2 to 1. From that date forward, versions only display the first two levels (e.g. _Firefox 64.0.2_ is now reported as _Firefox 64.0_). |
| End of life for Ad Hoc Analysis | Updated January 29, 2019 | On August 6, 2018, Adobe announced the intention to end-of-life Ad Hoc Analysis. An end-of-life date will be shared once available.<br/>For more information, including which versions of Java will be compatible during this period, visit [Discover Workspace](https://adobe.ly/discoverworkspace). |
| Short Analytics report links | January 14, 2019 | Any short Analytics report links that have not been visited within one year will be cleaned up and deleted starting on Thursday, January 17, 2019, on a rolling schedule. |
| End of Support for TLS 1.0 | Updated January 10, 2019 | On February 11, 2019 Adobe Analytics reporting will no longer support TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.0 encryption. This change is part of our ongoing efforts to maintain the highest security standards and promote the safety of customer data. If you are unable to connect to Adobe Analytics reporting after February11, 2019, you should upgrade your browser to the [latest version](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/user/requirements.html).<br/> Beginning February 20, 2019 Adobe Analytics data collection will no longer support TLS 1.0. With this change, Adobe will no longer collect Analytics data from end users with older devices or web browsers that do not support TLS 1.1 or later. We do not expect this to have a significant impact on customer data or reporting. (If your website already does not support TLS 1.0, you will not be affected.) <br/>Beginning April 11, 2019, the Adobe Analytics Reporting API will no longer support TLS 1.0 encryption. Customers who access the API should verify that they will not be impacted. <br/>* API clients using Java 7 with default settings will need [modifications to support TLS 1.2](https://www.java.com/en/configure_crypto.html). (Refer to _Changing default TLS protocol version for client end points: TLS 1.0 to TLS 1.2_.) <br/>* API clients using Java 8 should not be impacted because the default setting is TLS 1.2. <br/>* API clients using other frameworks will need to contact their vendors for details on TLS 1.2 support.|
| Update Adobe Report Builder due to end of support for TLS 1.0 | September 7, 2018 | Due to the end of support for TLS 1.0, we recommended that Adobe Report Builder (ARB) users download ARB v5.6.21 prior to February 7, 2019. **After that date, prior versions of ARB no longer function.** |
| Update to CSV downloads from Analysis Workspace | January 9, 2019 | Starting on February 7, 2019, CSV downloads (and Copy to Clipboard) from Analysis Workspace will no longer include the thousands separator. Note: The Analysis Workspace UI will continue to show the thousands separator. Additionally, the decimal separator will continue to be included, and will adhere to the format defined under **[!UICONTROL Components]** > **[!UICONTROL Report Settings]** > **[!UICONTROL Thousands Separator]**. |
| Data Feed: post_product_list column - size change | January 9, 2019 | On February 7, 2019, Adobe plans to expand the size of the post_product_list column from 64 KB to 16 MB. This change is intended to ensure that merchandising eVar values added to post_product_list during processing do not cause truncation of product and revenue values. If you have processes that ingest post_product_list values, please ensure those processes can handle values up to 16 MB in length, or will truncate the value at 16 KB to avoid data ingestion failures. |
| Management changes affecting inactive Analytics Live Stream endpoints | December 20, 2018 | Starting on February 1, 2019, Live Stream endpoints with no active consumer connections for 90 days may be disabled. You can reach out to Customer Care to inquire about your Live Stream endpoints and, if necessary, have them re-enabled. In addition, please ensure your consumer processes maintain a persistent connection, as intended by the design of the service, and that they are implemented to reconnect when the connection is disconnected or interrupted. |
| Dallas FTP server migration (ftp2.omniture.com) | October 19, 2018 | On October 23, 2018, if you connect to ftp2.omniture.com via the SFTP protocol, you might be required to re-accept the SJ1 site's host identifier. This issue applies only to October 23. See [Upgrading Adobe FTP Servers](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/whitepapers/ftp/ftp_upgrade.html). |
| Update to Mobile Device dimension | October 16, 2018 | On September 26, Adobe updated its device lookup to Device Atlas's 2.1 API. This caused more detailed devices (e.g. Apple iPhone 7, Apple iPhone 8 Plus, etc.) to appear in the Mobile Device dimension for some browsers. This new level of device detail should be used directionally as is does not extend to all devices and browser types at this time. |
| End of support for Internet Explorer 11 | Sept. 12, 2018 | Adobe will end support for Internet Explorer 11 within Adobe Analytics on November 13, 2018. Please switch to Microsoft Edge or another supported browser as soon as possible. |
| End of life for Ad Hoc Analysis | August 9, 2018 | On August 6, 2018, Adobe announced the intention to end-of-life Ad Hoc Analysis. An end-of-life date will be shared once available. For more information, visit [Discover Workspace](https://spark.adobe.com/page/S9Bhp66VJ2fEn/). We will not modify [!UICONTROL Ad Hoc Analysis] to support Java 9+ from this point forward. If you upgrade to Java 9+, [!UICONTROL Ad Hoc Analysis] will cease to function. Only Java 8 will be supported. |
| Update Adobe [!UICONTROL Report Builder] due to end of support for TLS 1.0 | Sept. 7, 2018 | Due to the end of support for TLS 1.0, we recommended that [!UICONTROL Report Builder] (ARB) users download ARB v5.6.21 prior to February 2019. After that date, prior versions of ARB will no longer function. |
| New help for the Analytics user migration | May 10, 2018 | We updated the Analytics user ID migration help with information about migrating Enterprise and Federated IDs to the Admin Console. See [Migrate Analytics user accounts for Enterprise and Federated IDs](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/experience-cloud/admin-console/analytics-migration/migrate-enterprise.html). |
| Upcoming removal of Account Activity Report | May 10, 2018 | The Account Activity Report will be replaced by the Server Call Usage feature in the Adobe Analytics Summer Release. The Account Activity Report will be permanently removed on August 9, 2018. To view summary data about report suite traffic after August 9, 2018, use the Server Call Usage feature. |
| Changes to linear allocation models in Calculated Metrics | Effective July 19, 2018 | On July 19th, Adobe Analytics will revise the way allocation models in calculated metrics are evaluated. As part of this change, calculated metrics that use a non-default allocation model will be migrated to new and improved attribution models. [!UICONTROL Marketing Channel Last Touch] and [!UICONTROL Marketing Channel First Touch] allocation models will be migrated to new [!UICONTROL Last Touch] and [!UICONTROL First Touch] attribution models  espectively. ([!UICONTROL Marketing Channels] are not being deprecated, only the two allocation models that appear in calculated metrics). Additionally, we will correct the way linear allocation is calculated. If you use calculated metrics with linear allocation models, the reports may change slightly to reflect the new, corrected attribution model. This change to calculated metrics will be reflected in [!UICONTROL Analysis Workspace], [!UICONTROL Reports & Analytics], the [!UICONTROL Reporting API], [!UICONTROL Report Builder], and [!UICONTROL Ad Hoc Analysis]. See the [Calculated Metrics](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/analytics/calcmetrics/m_metric_type_alloc.html) documentation for more information about this change. |
| [!UICONTROL Anomaly Detection] and [!UICONTROL Contribution Analysis] functionality removed from [!UICONTROL Reports & Analytics] | April 10, 2018 | Anomaly Detection and Contribution Analysis have been removed from the Reports & Analytics feature set and are now available only via Analysis Workspace. Adobe Analytics Select and Foundation customers have access only to “daily-granularity” Anomaly Detection in Workspace. |
| Adobe no longer issuing 3rd-party s_vi cookies for Safari | April 05, 2018 | On March 20, 2018, Adobe stopped issuing third-party s_vi cookies for the Safari browser. This change does not impact customers using first-party data collection cookies. This change also removes the visit and visitor inflation experienced by some customers, resulting from Safari ITP. |
| Update Report Builder before you migrate user IDs to the Admin Console | March 17, 2018 | **Important:** Update your installation of Report Builder to the latest version. This update is a pre-requisite for running the Analytics user ID migration to the Admin Console, beginning in April 2018. See [Analytics User Migration to the Admin Console] for migration information. |
| Back-end changes that affect reporting | April 11, 2018 | A change to the (back-end) lookup mechanism is going to impact reporting in several ways. Please be aware that these changes went into effect around the end of February, 2018: Page renaming will no longer be allowed. Going forward, you will need to use classifications to rename pages. Until the May 10, 2018 release, the system will continue to process the renamed pages as they are currently configured. Adobe is asking all customers to migrate to classifications by that date. After the May release, existing renames will no longer be honored and can change, retroactively, without notice. <br> <br>The URL replacement methodology is different. Previously, Adobe Analytics would store (mostly) the first URL associated with each page name each month. Going forward, we will store the most recent URL for each page name. (Updated April 11, 2018) Category reports for roll-ups and current data in Reports & Analytics are no longer provided. Deprecating category roll-up reports in the Web Service API is effective with the May 10, 2018, Adobe Analytics maintenance release. There is no longer any support for page/prop data from before approximately January 2007 (in some cases, 2006). This only impacts pages, props and page events (i.e. custom links, exit links, download links). Note: This change does not impact reporting in Analysis Workspace or Data Warehouse. If you have data preceding these dates, expect the following: Data will not combine correctly across the pre/post January 2007 boundary. Searches will not work against data before approximately Jan. 2007. |
| Upcoming support changes for Date-Enabled and Numeric Classifications | May 7, 2018 | In the May 10, 2018 Maintenance release, we will begin limiting the functionality of date-enabled and numeric classifications. These classification types will be removed from the Admin and Classification Importer interfaces. From that date on, no new date-enabled and numeric classifications can be added. Existing classifications can still be managed (uploaded to, deleted) through the standard classification workflow, and will continue to be available in reporting. |
| Upcoming support changes for Marketing Channel Cost and Budget | February 28, 2018 | In the April maintenance release, we will remove Marketing Channel Cost and Budget from the Admin > Marketing Channel menu. No new cost and budget data can be added. Existing cost and budget data will continue to be available in reporting, but cannot be updated. |
| Code Manager - Legacy H Code | February 8, 2018 | Downloading legacy JavaScript (H code) from the Code Manager is no longer supported. |
| Data retention: Check and set your data retention policy for Adobe Analytics | February 1, 2018 | **Background:** The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which applies as from May 25, 2018, provides that Adobe, in its role as your data processor, must take appropriate measures to assist its customers in fulfilling access, deletion, and other requests from individuals. Applying appropriate, secure, and timely deletion policies is an important part of complying with this obligation. As a result, Adobe would like to work with you to implement a data retention policy before GDPR takes effect on May 25, 2018.<br> <br>**What to expect:** Unless you already have an Adobe Analytics data retention policy in place, Adobe will begin applying data retention as currently specified in customer contracts for Adobe Analytics, unless other arrangements are made. Most Adobe Analytics contracts state that Adobe may delete data after 25 months. Once a data retention policy is in place for your organization, it is enforced on a rolling monthly basis. Data retention for longer periods than 25 months is available for an additional fee. Data retention periods for shorter periods can also be configured by contacting Customer Care. You will soon receive an email with additional details for your organization. <br> <br>Data retention impacts all methods for accessing historical Adobe Analytics data, including but not limited to Reports & Analytics, Analysis Workspace, Report Builder, the Web Services Reporting APIs, data warehouse, and data feeds. **Next steps:** Identify stakeholders within your organization responsible for making decisions about data retention. Your organization is best placed to know the appropriate period for which Adobe Analytics data should be retained. Contact your Adobe Customer Success Manager if you have questions regarding data retention for Adobe Analytics. |
| User account linking | October 26, 2017 | Analytics users no longer need to manually link their accounts between the Experience Cloud and Analytics. Users can contact their Admin Console administrator to request Analytics access. The Analytics user ID migration enables administrators to easily migrate user accounts from Analytics User Management to the Adobe Admin Console. After your users are migrated, they will have access to the purchased solutions and core services available in the Experience Cloud. [Learn more about the Analytics User ID Migration](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/experience-cloud/admin-console/analytics-migration/). |

## Audience Manager {#aam}

| Feature    | Description  |
| -----------| ---------- |  
| [Trait Recommendations](https://experiencecloud.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/trait-recommendations.html)  | Trait Recommendations, powered by [Adobe Sensei](https://www.adobe.com/sensei.html), brings data science into your Audience Manager day-to-day workflows. <br/>With Trait Recommendations, when you build or edit a segment in [Segment Builder](https://experiencecloud.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/t_create_segment.html), you get recommendations on additional traits you can include, that are similar to the traits in the segment rule. Add the recommended traits to your segment to increase your target audience. |  
| [Global Data Sources](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/global-data-sources.html) | Global data sources are accessible by all Audience Manager customers and contain device advertising IDs generated by device manufacturers such as Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, Roku, and Android device manufacturers. These IDs are made available by manufacturers for advertising purposes. You can use global data sources to synchronize device IDs and import or export data keyed off of those mappings.<br/>Audience Manager validates the device advertising IDs (DAID) imported by customers, based on their format, to ensure they match the standard format outlined by device manufacturers. |
| [ID Mapping Limits](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/usage-limits.html)  | We have improved segmentation, reporting, and exporting of segments by limiting the number of cross-device ID mappings associated to a device ID. The newly imposed limits help us mitigate the impact that incorrect integrations and inaccurate data sets may have on ingestion and downstream processing. The new limits are:<ul><li> 100 device IDs per cross-device ID</li><li>10 cross-device IDs per device ID</li><li> 1000 device IDs to 1 device ID</li></ul> |

**Fixes**

* We improved the segmentation logic for onboarded traits to align with rule-based traits. (AAM-40433)
* The [trait summary page](https://experiencecloud.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/c_tb_trait_summary.html) now displays the trait type. (AAM-25784)
* The [segment summary page](https://experiencecloud.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/c_segment_summary.html) now contains a hyperlink to the segment's data source, for easier navigation. (AAM-40015)
* Fixed an issue in the Destination Mapping modal in Segment Builder, where users clicking the Add Destination button more than once would create multiple mappings instead of one. (AAM-37177)
* Fixed a bug where the **[!UICONTROL Select All]** checkbox was missing in Algorithmic Models, in the [Select Traits to Exclude](https://experiencecloud.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/trait-exclusion-algo-models.html) page. (AAM-42462)
* Fixed a bug on Safari browsers, where users weren't able to check any Data Export Controls in the Create New Data Source page. (AAM-41178)

## Target {#target}

| Feature    | Description  |
| -----------| ---------- |  
| Visual Experience Composer  | The Visual Experience Composer (VEC) includes the following enhancements to make your work quicker and more efficient:<ul><li>You can now cancel the loading of a website in the VEC to unblock editing of an activity. This enhancement is useful, for example, if you want to make a small edit to the activity, review its settings, or add custom code and you don't want to wait for the site to load. Actions that cannot be edited before the site loads are disabled in the Target UI. (TGT-31288, TGT-31611, and TGT-32602)</li><li>The VEC displays the DOM tree so you can easily select the proper element while creating or editing experiences. (TGT-13422)</li></ul>|  

**Enhancements, Fixes, Changes**

You are now instructed to re-authenticate when your session expires while reviewing a report. After you log in again, you are directed back to the report. (TGT-32723)

Refer to the [Adobe Target Release Notes](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/target/using/release-notes/target-release-notes.html) for the latest release information about the following products:

* Target Standard and Premium
* Recommendations Classic

## Campaign {#ac}

Adobe Campaign provides an intuitive, automated way to deliver one-to-one messages across online and offline marketing channels. You can now anticipate what your clients want using experiences determined by their habits and preferences.

### Push channel Reporting improvements 

Several enhancements have been added to Push channel reporting to allow you to measure user engagement more intuitively. With this release, we are expanding the list of Push channel metrics to three different metrics:

* Impressions
* Clicks
* Opens (App Open)

These help you measure and analyze users' interaction with Push notifications more effectively. We are also standardizing the definition and implementation of these metrics. The Push notification built-in report has also been improved with commonly used visualizations and metrics.

For more information, see [Push notification report](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/standard/reporting/using/push-notification-report.html).

### [!DNL Launch] integration for Mobile App

This release contains the integration of Adobe Campaign with the general available (GA) versions of Android and iOS extensions for Adobe Campaign Standard in Adobe Experience Platform Launch and Mobile SDKs. These extensions support push messaging, in-app messaging, and mobile app profile updates.

For more information, see [Using Adobe Experience Platform SDK](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/standard/administration/using/configuring-a-mobile-application.html#main-pars_header_49).

### Mobile In-App Messaging

This release contains the GA version of In-App channel in Campaign. From a functional standpoint, the most notable additions to the Beta release are Dynamic reports for In-App channel and secure handshake between Mobile SDK and MCIAS (Marketing Cloud In-App Messaging Service that serves the In-App rules to the SDK). Secure handshake ensures that your users' PII data does not fall into malicious hands and enables you to maintain users' privacy on a shared device by clearing out message cache every time the user logs out.

For more information, see [About In-App messaging](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/standard/channels/using/about-in-app-messaging.html) and the dedicated [In-App tutorial](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/kt/acs/using/acs-in-app-message-tutorial.html).

### Workflow enhancements 

The following workflow capabilities have been added:

* You can now copy-paste activities within a workflow or another workflow from the same Campaign instance. That way, you can easily duplicate an entire workflow or specific activities, and keep the settings that were initially defined. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/standard/automating/using/workflow-interface.html#duplicating-workflow-activities). (CAMP-20014)
* When using the **Load file** activity, you can now add a timestamp to the name of the file containing the rejected records. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/standard/automating/using/load-file.html#configuration).
* **Query** and **Segmentation** activities now let you enable an outbound transition if the activities retrieve no data.

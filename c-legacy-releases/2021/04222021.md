| Data Feed and Data Warehouse IP Address Changes | April 6, 2021 | Starting June 17, the Data Feeds and Data Warehouse delivery system will be relocated within Adobe's data centers, and therefore can cause a change of external IP addresses visible to you. Adobe recommends that you confirm that all the IP CIDR blocks for the data center where your reports and feeds are sourced are present in firewalls for destination systems that you control. [Here is a full list of IP Address ranges to place into your firewallâ€™s allowlists](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/technotes/ip-addresses.html#data-collection-and-ftp-ip-address-blocks). |

All of these pages will still be available under the **[!UICONTROL All Components]**, **[!UICONTROL All Tools]**, and **[!UICONTROL All Admin]** links - they will be removed from the dropdown menu. Here are the menu items that will be removed from the dropdown menu and placed on their respective link page:<br><br> [!UICONTROL Components]<ul><li>[!UICONTROL Bookmarks]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Dashboards]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Targets]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Calendar Events]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Scheduled Reports]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Report Settings]</li></ul>[!UICONTROL Tools]<ul><li>[!UICONTROL Recommendations Classic]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Search & Promote]</li></ul>[!UICONTROL Admin]<ul><li>[!UICONTROL User Management]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Classification Importer]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Classification Rule Builder]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Data Sources]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Data Connectors]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Company Settings]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Logs]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Dynamic Tag Management]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Code Manager]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Exclude by IP]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Traffic Management]</li></ul> |

This change impacts Data Warehouse reporting by processing the data to match processing rules. For questions or clarification, reach out to Customer Care. |
| Reports & Analytics landing page options | February 19, 2021 | On March 25, 2021, options to set new Reports & Analytics dashboards or other content as your Adobe Analytics landing page were removed.

| End-of-life for three Analytics API services | January 6, 2021 | On April 30, 2021, the following Analytics Legacy API services are slated to reach their end-of-life date and will be shut down. Any current integrations built using these services stop working on that day.<ul><li>1.3 Analytics APIs</li><li>1.4 SOAP Analytics APIs</li><li>Legacy OAuth Authentication (OAuth and JWT)</li></ul>We have provided a [Legacy API EOL FAQ](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-1.4-apis/blob/master/docs/APIEOL.md?mv=email)â€¯to help answer your questions and provide guidance on how to proceed. API integrations that employ these services can migrate to the [1.4 Analytics REST APIs](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-1.4-apis?mv=email) or the [2.0 Analytics APIs](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-2.0-apis?mv=email). Legacy OAuth accounts can migrate to an [Adobe I/O](https://console.adobe.io/home?mv=email#) Analytics integration account, which can be used to access both the 1.4 Analytics APIs and 2.0 Analytics APIs. |
| EOL of Adobe Data Connectors | July 13, 2020 | Adobe [!UICONTROL Data Connectors] are powered by legacy technology that is no longer viable or supported. A new standard is available in the [Adobe Exchange Partner Program](https://partners.adobe.com/exchangeprogram/experiencecloud).

**Fixes** 

This [!DNL  Social] release focuses on improved performance, scalability, usability, and reliability. More than 140 back-end fixes and enhancements address these areas. The fixes highlighted below describe resolutions for the more important customer-reported issues. 

* Fixed an issue that caused incorrect data to display for Facebook pages in the [!UICONTROL Competitor Analytics] report.
* Fixed an issue that caused discrepancies in the number of reported Twitter followers.
* Fixed an issue that prevented tracking parameters from appending to posts created using the [!UICONTROL Publish Anywhere] feature.
* Fixed an issue that sometimes caused posts to fail with a timeout error.
* Fixed an issue with shortened links where links to pages within a website redirected to the company's homepage.
* Fixed an issue that caused some invalid content (posts, comments, and replies) to appear in moderation feeds. Code enhancements will help our collection system more effectively block Invalid content that does not match the page.

## [!DNL Target]

Refer to the [Adobe Target Release Notes](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/target/using/release-notes/release-notes.html) for the latest release information about the following products: 

* Target Standard and Premium
* Target Classic
* Recommendations Classic

## [!DNL Audience Manager]

|  Feature  | Description  |
|---|---|
|  [Audience Marketplace](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/c_audience_marketplace.html)  | [!DNL  Audience Marketplace] provides specialized features that lets data buyers and data providers execute data deals in a self-service manner with minimum effort. Talk to your [!DNL  Audience Manager] consultant to get started. They can activate [!DNL  Audience Marketplace] for you.  |

**Fixes, Enhancements, and Deprecations** 

* [Create Groups](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/t_create_groups.html): Simplified steps and directions for creating groups and assigning permissions.
* [Understanding Wild Card Permissions](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/c_wildcard_permissions.html): Use [!DNL  Wild Card Permissions] to give group members access to new data sources automatically. With standard permissions, you must manually assign new data sources to a group.

**Known Issues** 

In the VisitorAPI / AppMeasurement Audience Manager Module integrations, there will be two destination publishing iFrame requests made in IE6-9: `//fast.<subdomain>.demdex.net/dest5.html` and `//fast.<subdomain>.demdex.net/dest4.html`. The correct behavior, as seen in other browsers, is to only load `//fast.<subdomain>.demdex.net/dest5.html`.

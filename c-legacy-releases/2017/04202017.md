**Fixes, Enhancements, and Deprecations**

* Fixed an issue where, for some customers, the full URL string wouldn't be saved when mapping a URL to a URL destination. (AAM-28510)
* Fixed an issue in Profile Merge Rules for RBAC users, where users with no permissions to view traits were shown a blank page instead of the warning message that they don't have permissions to view the page. (AAM-28361)
* Fixed an issue where, for some customers, the Traits List page would contain broken links to Data Sources. (AAM-29174)
* We improved the Profile Link feature. The feature now links an [Audience Manager UUID](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/ids-in-aam.html) to another three Audience Manager UUIDs, for a total of 4 Audience Manager UUIDs in a cluster. (AAM-28808)
* We now expose the Test Segment IDs ( [SID and csegID](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/ids-in-aam.html)) with a query parameter testSegments=true in the following APIs (AAM-27591): 
    * ` .../v1/segments`
    * ` .../v1/destinations/<destinationId>/mappings`

* Migrated the segments API methods to Swagger. See [Audience Manager API Code Migration](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/c_api_swagger.html). (AAM-28601)
* Removed a couple of small visual bugs in Addressable Audience for DAID destinations. (AAM-28679)
* Fixed an issue in the User Administration page where no error message was shown when a customer attempted to create a new user for a company, with a username that was already taken. (AAM-28945)
* Fixed a visual bug where wrong icons were displayed in the password reset modal, in Audience Marketplace and in sorting columns in list pages across the user interface. (AAM-28953)
* Fixed an issue in the Audience Manager Admin interface where an Audience Marketplace End User ID couldn't be added to a company. (AAM-28953)

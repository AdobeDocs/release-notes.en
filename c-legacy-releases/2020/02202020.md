## Adobe System Status {#status}

[!UICONTROL Adobe System Status] provides detailed information, status updates, and email notifications about Adobe cloud products and services outage, disruption, and maintenance events. Check it out at [status.adobe.com](https://status.adobe.com/).

**What's new**

* Using your Adobe ID, you can subscribe to event notifications based on your product, region, event, and language preferences. Users who configure their subscription preferences are notified of relevant product incident and maintenance events as soon as they are opened, updated, or closed. Get started at [status.adobe.com/subscriptions](https://status.adobe.com/proactive-notifications/subscriptions/edit).

**New features and enhancements available today**

| Feature    | Description  |
| -----------| ---------- |
|Faster awareness of product events | <ul><li>Get informed 30 days in advance of upcoming service maintenance. This feature provides more lead time to assess the potential impact on your business operations, enabling you to implement a mitigation plan if necessary.</li><li>Advanced notifications are available on Web/mobile/tablet surfaces and via email notifications.</li></ul> |
|Personalize your experience based on preferred language | <ul><li>Choose a preferred language for email notifications. The Self-subscription feature is now available in nineteen languages.</li></ul> |
|Improved subscription and notification user experience | <ul><li>Specify the region and event preferences in just one selection for all products to which you want to subscribe.</li><li>Get notified when _Potential_ issues are promoted to _Minor_ or _Major_ ones.</li><li>The browser page automatically refreshes when any product or event status is updated.</li></ul> |

## Experience Cloud interface and core services {#ecloud}

Release update: **February 26, 2016**

New features and fixes in the Experience Cloud interface, including administration and core services (customer attributes, audiences, triggers, cookies, and so on).

| Feature    | Description  |
| -----------| ---------- |
|Admin Tool - view user details |Administrators can view a sortable and filterable list of all Experience Cloud users and their details in the new Admin Tool. User details include a user’s product access, roles, and last accessed information. See [Experience Cloud Admin Tool](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/core-services/interface/manage-users-and-products/admin-tool-experience-cloud.html?lang=en) help for details.|

**Fixes**

* **Customer Attributes:** Customer Attributes UI now displays additional statuses of profiles synced in Target. (MCUI-10231)
* **Triggers Core Service:** Due to lack of use, the propensity score "Likelihood to Return in 30 days" when creating an Abandonment type trigger has been removed. (MCUI-10056)

### Unified product domain

Adobe is updating the domain and interface header to unify and improve your experience across all Experience Cloud applications. These enhancements are designed to simplify your experience in small but important ways. These enhancements will not change your current workflows.

Updates include:

* New solution URLs: `experience.adobe.com/<application name>`:
  * All products will eventually adopt this URL pattern. Look for new URLs to become effective throughout the month.
  * Browser support: Supported browsers include [!DNL Microsoft® Edge], [!DNL Google Chrome], [!DNL Firefox], [!DNL Safari], and [!DNL Opera] (latest versions). **Note:** Although the Experience Cloud interface supports these browsers, individual solutions might not support every browser. (For example, [Analytics](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/admin/sys-reqs.html?lang=en) does not support [!DNL Opera], and [Target](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/implement-target/before-implement/supported-browsers.html?lang=en) does not support [!DNL Safari].)
  * ([!DNL Safari] only) The domain change may cause cookie issues in [!DNL Safari]. Deselecting _Prevent cross-site tracking_ in the [!DNL Safari] Privacy Preferences enables cookies across domains (and all cross-site experiences), and allows Experience Cloud to function on this new domain.
* Easier switching between your organizations or to a different application.
* Improved product help: [!UICONTROL Experience League] is integrated into the product so that a help search also includes results from community forums and video content. This change simplifies access to more content and helps you get the most out of Experience Cloud. Additionally, select **[!UICONTROL Help]** > **[!UICONTROL Feedback]** to report issues or share your ideas with Adobe.  
* Improved notifications: The [!UICONTROL Notifications] drop-down menu now has two tabs, one for your own product notifications and one for global product announcements.

**Note:** The [!UICONTROL Feed] page is being deprecated in January, 2020. Look for an in-product deprecation notice.

For product documentation, see [Experience Cloud](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/core-services/interface/experience-cloud.html?lang=en).

## Experience Platform {#platform}

Release notes for the Experience Platform, Experience Platform Launch, Identity Service, and security bulletins.  

* [Experience Platform Release Notes](https://www.adobe.com/go/platform-release-notes-en)
* [Experience Platform Launch](#launch)

* **Chromium-based Microsoft® Edge browser:** This release includes changes to recognize the Chromium-based Microsoft® Edge browser (version 79 and above) for reporting purposes.

#### Fixes

* Fixed an issue with Segment UI saying that [!UICONTROL Marketing Channel] dimensions were compatible with [!UICONTROL Data Warehouse], when in reality they are not. In the future, the [!UICONTROL Segment Builder] will no longer show these dimensions as being [!UICONTROL Data Warehouse] compatible. (AN-202297)

## Adobe System Status {#status}

[!UICONTROL Adobe System Status] provides detailed information, status updates, and email notifications about Adobe cloud products and services outage, disruption, and maintenance events. Check it out at [status.adobe.com](https://status.adobe.com/).

**What's new**

* Using your Adobe ID, you can subscribe to event notifications with more granularity, down to the product offering and add-on level. Furthermore in our latest release, the self-subscription process now recommends a selection of products and services based on your product entitlements. This should streamline the subscription process by reducing the number of decisions or clicks required to create your subscriptions, and most importantly, deliver more relevant notifications in your inbox. Get started at [status.adobe.com/subscriptions](https://status.adobe.com/proactive-notifications/subscriptions/edit).

**New features and enhancements available today**

| Feature    | Description  |
| -----------| ---------- |
|Personalized subscriptions based on entitlements | <ul><li>Pre-selected subscription recommendations based on the user's DX entitlements.</li><li>Recommended subscriptions are highlighted at the top of the product list for quick visualization.</li><li>Email notifications received are relevant to the user's product entitlements.</li></ul> |
|Easier Management of Subscriptions| <ul><li>**[!UICONTROL Manage Subscriptions]** has a new user experience to manage both product and event subscriptions.</li><li>New option to view and edit product and event subscriptions separately.</li><li>The **[!UICONTROL Delete]** option allows you to unsubscribe from a product or event subscription.</li><li>The one-click **[!UICONTROL Unsubscribe all]** option is available for the product subscriptions.</li><li>UX support is available for Web/Mobile/Tablet surfaces and localization in 19 languages.</li></ul> |

## Experience Cloud interface {#ecloud}

New features and fixes in the Experience Cloud interface:

* Experience Cloud [!UICONTROL Feed] page was deprecated. (EXC-8505)
* Experience Cloud login page was updated to reflect new branding elements. (EXC-10747)

For product documentation, see [Experience Cloud interface help](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/core-services/interface/experience-cloud.html).

### Unified product domain

Adobe is updating the domain and interface header to unify and improve your experience across all Experience Cloud applications. These enhancements are designed to simplify your experience in small but important ways. These enhancements will not change your current workflows.

Updates include:

* New application URLs: `experience.adobe.com/<application name>`:
  * All products will eventually adopt this URL pattern. Look for new URLs to become effective throughout the month.
  * ([!DNL Safari] only) The domain change may cause cookie issues in [!DNL Safari]. Deselecting _Prevent cross-site tracking_ in the [!DNL Safari] Privacy Preferences enables cookies across domains (and all cross-site experiences), and allows Experience Cloud to function on this new domain.
* Easier switching between your organizations or to a different application.
* Improved product help: [!UICONTROL Experience League] is integrated into the product so that a help search also includes results from community forums and video content. This change simplifies access to more content and helps you get the most out of Experience Cloud. Additionally, select **[!UICONTROL Help]** > **[!UICONTROL Feedback]** to report issues or share your ideas with Adobe.

### Important notices for [!DNL Analytics] administrators {#aa-notices}

| Notice | Date Added or Updated  | Description |
| -----------| ---------- | ---------- |
|Change to how [!UICONTROL Entries/Exits] are calculated in [!UICONTROL Workspace]|April 7, 2020|In [!UICONTROL Analysis Workspace], as of March 2020, we have changed how the _None_ value interacts with [!UICONTROL Entries/Exits]. Because you can now turn _Nones_ on and off in [!UICONTROL Analysis Workspace], we apply the _None_ value after the entry or exit, whereas (for eVars) it used to be applied before. For example, assume the first hit of a visit has no value for eVars, but the second hit does. In [!UICONTROL Reports & Analytics] it will show up as _Unspecified_ for the Entry, but in [!UICONTROL Analysis Workspace] it will show up as the value on the second hit.|
|EOL of **[!UICONTROL Conversion Level]** setting|March 3, 2020|The non-functioning [Conversion Level](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/admin/admin-tools/general-acct-settings-admin.html) setting in **[!UICONTROL Admin Tools]** > **[!UICONTROL Report Suites]** > **[!UICONTROL General Account Settings]** will be removed from the interface on March 12, 2020.|
|EOL of **[!UICONTROL Dashboard Archive]**|March 27, 2020|The **[!UICONTROL View Archive]** setting under **[!UICONTROL Manage Dashboards]** in [!UICONTROL Reports & Analytics] will no longer be available as of October  2020.|
|End of Support for TLS 1.1 | October 3, 2019 | By March 31, 2020, Adobe Analytics will remove support for TLS 1.1. This change is part of our ongoing efforts to maintain the highest security standards and promote the safety of customer data.|
|New Adobe Analytics domain|Dec. 18, 2019|On January 16, 2020, Adobe Analytics began moving to a new domain - `https://experience.adobe.com/analytics.`<br>**Note:** This change applies to all users accessing Analytics with their Adobe ID or Enterprise ID. <ul><li>The domain change may cause cookie issues when loading Analytics in Safari. Deselecting _Prevent cross-site tracking_ in the [!DNL Safari] Privacy Preferences enables cookies across domains (and all cross-site experiences), and allows Analytics to function on this new Adobe Experience Cloud domain. You can use other browsers without issue because this affects only [!DNL Safari] users.</li><li>The domain change may cause [!UICONTROL Activity Map] to stop working for some customers [in specific cases](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/activity-map/activity-map.html).</li></ul>|
|End of Life - Analytics Legacy APIs|January 9, 2020|In November 2020, the following Analytics Legacy API services will reach their end-of-life and will be shutdown. Current integrations built using these services will stop working. <ul><li>1.3 Analytics APIs</li><li>1.4 SOAP Analytics APIs</li><li>Legacy OAuth Authentication (OAuth and JWT)</li></ul>We have provided a [Legacy API EOL FAQ](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-1.4-apis/blob/master/docs/APIEOL.md?mv=email) to help answer your questions and provide guidance on how to proceed. API integrations that employ these services can migrate to the [1.4 Analytics REST APIs](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-1.4-apis?mv=email) or the [2.0 Analytics APIs](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-2.0-apis?mv=email). Legacy OAuth accounts can migrate to an [Adobe Developer](https://console.adobe.io/home?mv=email) Analytics integration account, which can be used to access both the 1.4 Analytics APIs and 2.0 Analytics APIs.|
|San Jose FTP Broker Ending for London and Singapore|July 2020|For customers in London and Singapore, we will no longer support brokering of data between London or Singapore and the San Jose data center [ftp.omniture.com](ftp://ftp.omniture.com/).<br/><ul><li>For London, use [ftp3.omniture.com](ftp://ftp3.omniture.com/)</li><li>For Singapore, use [ftp4.omniture.com](ftp://ftp4.omniture.com/)</li></ul>|
|EOL of Ad Hoc Analysis|Aug 6, 2018|Adobe announced the intention to end-of-life Ad Hoc Analysis. An end-of-life date will be shared once available. For more information, visit [Discover Workspace](https://spark.adobe.com/page/S9Bhp66VJ2fEn/).|

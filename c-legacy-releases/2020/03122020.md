## ![Icon](/assets/adobe.png) Adobe System Status {#status}

[!UICONTROL Adobe System Status] provides detailed information, status updates, and email notifications about Adobe cloud products and services outage, disruption, and maintenance events. Check it out at [status.adobe.com](https://status.adobe.com/).

**What's new**

* Using your Adobe ID, you can subscribe to event notifications with more granularity, down to the product offering and add-on level. Look for this new capability in Experience Cloud products, where the self-subscription process displays sub-offerings for the products and services to which you want to subscribe. This enhancement should significantly reduce the volume of notifications you receive, and make the notifications more relevant to the products and features you use.  Get started at [status.adobe.com/subscriptions](https://status.adobe.com/proactive-notifications/subscriptions/edit).

**New features and enhancements available today**

| Feature    | Description  |
| -----------| ---------- |
|Personalized self-subscription by product sub-offerings | <ul><li>Self-subscription by product offering or add-ons for Experience Cloud products.</li><li>Event notifications received are relevant to your product and product offerings preferences.</li></ul> |
|Personalized experience based on user preferences| <ul><li>Timezone preference based on browser setting is used in email notifications.</li><li>Email confirmation sent on subscribe/unsubscribe with all selected preferences.</li></ul> |
|Better delivery of event messages | <ul><li>Event history sorted based on chronological event updates.</li><li>Timestamp of event resolution added to Major/Minor closed issues.</li></ul> |

## ![Icon](/assets/ec_appicon_24.png) Experience Cloud interface and core services {#ecloud}

New features and fixes in the Experience Cloud interface, including administration and core services (customer attributes, audiences, triggers, cookies, and so on).

| Feature    |Release date | Description  |
| ----|----|---- |
|Admin Tool - view user details |February 26, 2020 |Administrators can view a sortable and filterable list of all Experience Cloud users and their details in the new Admin Tool. User details include a user’s product access, roles, and last accessed information. See [Experience Cloud Admin Tool](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/core-services/interface/manage-users-and-products/admin-tool-experience-cloud.html) help for details.|

### Unified product domain

Adobe is updating the domain and interface header to unify and improve your experience across all Experience Cloud applications. These enhancements are designed to simplify your experience in small but important ways. These enhancements will not change your current workflows.

Updates include:

* New solution URLs: `experience.adobe.com/<application name>`:
  * All products will eventually adopt this URL pattern. Look for new URLs to become effective throughout the month.
  * Browser support: Supported browsers include [!DNL Microsoft Edge], [!DNL Google Chrome], [!DNL Firefox], [!DNL Safari], and [!DNL Opera] (latest versions). **Note:** Although the Experience Cloud interface supports these browsers, individual solutions might not support every browser. (For example, [Analytics](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/admin/sys-reqs.html) does not support [!DNL Opera], and [Target](https://docs.adobe.com/help/en/target/using/implement-target/before-implement/supported-browsers.html) does not support [!DNL Safari].)
  * ([!DNL Safari] only) The domain change may cause cookie issues in [!DNL Safari]. Deselecting _Prevent cross-site tracking_ in the [!DNL Safari] Privacy Preferences enables cookies across domains (and all cross-site experiences), and allows Experience Cloud to function on this new domain.
* Easier switching between your organizations or to a different application.
* Improved product help: [!UICONTROL Experience League] is integrated into the product so that a help search also includes results from community forums and video content. This change simplifies access to more content and helps you get the most out of Experience Cloud. Additionally, click **[!UICONTROL Help]** > **[!UICONTROL Feedback]** to report issues or share your ideas with Adobe.  
* Improved notifications: The [!UICONTROL Notifications] drop-down menu now has two tabs, one for your own product notifications and one for global product announcements.

**Note:** The [!UICONTROL Feed] page was deprecated in January, 2020. Look for an in-product deprecation notice.

For product documentation, see [Experience Cloud](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/core-services/interface/experience-cloud.html) help.

#### Fixes

* Fixed an issue in [!UICONTROL Reports & Analytics] that prevented downloading `.xls` reports. This issue affected customers using currencies other than US Dollar and Euro. (AN-206541, AN-204008)
* The rollout of a new shell fixed several customer issues related to switching Experience Cloud organizations.(AN-200844, AN-186920)
* Fixed an issue where doing a breakdown on the _Unspecified_ line item (or some other reporting line items) while not including _Unspecified (None)_ in the search filters of the breakdown would return no results in the breakdown.
* Fixed an issue occurring when using a classified dimension, the entry or exit metric totals would not match the line item total on a breakdown.
* Fixed an issue where first touch and last touch models in Attribution IQ were not calculating credit correctly for some line items in some out of the box dimensions.

* Fixed an issue where sometimes entry or exit metrics would be counted incorrectly when applied to “Unspecified” in a classified dimension report.

### Important notices for [!DNL Analytics] administrators {#aa-notices}

| Notice | Date Added or Updated  | Description |
| -----------| ---------- | ---------- |
|Change to how Entries/Exits are calculated in Workspace|April 7, 2020|In Analysis Workspace, as of March 2020, we have changed how the "None" value interacts with Entries/Exits. Because you can now turn "Nones" on and off in Analysis Workspace, we apply the "None" after the entry or exit, whereas (for eVars) it used to be applied before. For example, assume the first hit of a visit has no value for eVarx, but the second hit does. In Reports & Analytics it will show up as "Unspecified" for the Entry, but in Analysis Workspace it will show up as the value on the second hit.|
|EOL of **[!UICONTROL Conversion Level]** setting|March 3, 2020|The non-functioning [Conversion Level](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/admin/admin-tools/general-acct-settings-admin.html) setting in **[!UICONTROL Admin Tools] > [!UICONTROL Report Suites] > [!UICONTROL General Account Settings]** will be removed from the UI on March 12, 2020.|
|EOL of **[!UICONTROL Dashboard Archive]**|March 27, 2020|The **[!UICONTROL View Archive]** setting under **[!UICONTROL Manage Dashboards]** in [!UICONTROL Reports & Analytics] will no longer be available as of October, 2020.|
|End of Support for TLS 1.1 | October 3, 2019 | By March 31, 2020, Adobe Analytics will remove support for TLS 1.1. This change is part of our ongoing efforts to maintain the highest security standards and promote the safety of customer data.|
|New Adobe Analytics domain|Dec. 18, 2019|On January 16, 2020, Adobe Analytics began moving to a new domain - `https://experience.adobe.com/analytics.`<br>**Note:** This change applies to all users accessing Analytics with their Adobe ID or Enterprise ID. <ul><li>The domain change may cause cookie issues when loading Analytics in Safari. Deselecting _Prevent cross-site tracking_ in the [!DNL Safari] Privacy Preferences enables cookies across domains (and all cross-site experiences), and allows Analytics to function on this new Adobe Experience Cloud domain. You can use other browsers without issue because this affects only [!DNL Safari] users.</li><li>The domain change may cause [!UICONTROL Activity Map] to stop working for some customers [in specific cases](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/analyze/activity-map/activity-map.html).</li></ul>|
|End of Life - Analytics Legacy APIs|January 9, 2020|In November 2020, the following Analytics Legacy API services will reach their end-of-life and will be shutdown. Current integrations built using these services will stop working. <ul><li>1.3 Analytics APIs</li><li>1.4 SOAP Analytics APIs</li><li>Legacy OAuth Authentication (OAuth and JWT)</li></ul>We have provided a [Legacy API EOL FAQ](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-1.4-apis/blob/master/docs/APIEOL.md?mv=email) to help answer your questions and provide guidance on how to proceed. API integrations that employ these services can migrate to the [1.4 Analytics REST APIs](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-1.4-apis?mv=email) or the [2.0 Analytics APIs](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-2.0-apis?mv=email). Legacy OAuth accounts can migrate to an [Adobe IO](https://console.adobe.io/home?mv=email) Analytics integration account, which can be used to access both the 1.4 Analytics APIs and 2.0 Analytics APIs.|
|San Jose FTP Broker Ending for London and Singapore|July 2020|For customers in London and Singapore, we will no longer support brokering of data between London or Singapore and the San Jose data center [ftp.omniture.com](ftp://ftp.omniture.com/).<br/><ul><li>For London, use [ftp3.omniture.com](ftp://ftp3.omniture.com/)</li><li>For Singapore, use [ftp4.omniture.com](ftp://ftp4.omniture.com/)</li></ul>|
|EOL of Ad Hoc Analysis|Aug 6, 2018|Adobe announced the intention to end-of-life Ad Hoc Analysis. An end-of-life date will be shared once available. For more information, visit [Discover Workspace](https://spark.adobe.com/page/S9Bhp66VJ2fEn/).|

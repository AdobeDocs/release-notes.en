### Important notices for [!DNL Analytics] administrators {#aa-notices}

| Notice | Date Added or Updated  | Description |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
|Adding HSTS header to all incoming HTTPS requests | Sept. 29, 2020 | On Sept. 29, 2020, we started adding the HSTS header to all incoming requests that use HTTPS. This instructs the browser/client to make all future requests in HTTPS, which is a considered a security best practice. At this point, we will not enforce this for incoming requests using HTTP. |
| Change to Experience Cloud ID Service cookie setting | Sept. 22, 2020 | An update to the privacy settings for Chrome version 80 impacted the ability of Adobe Analytics to track some users viewing Google AMP pages. Specifically, it prevents cross-domain tracking of users viewing Google-hosted AMP pages. This could result in inflated counts of unique visitors. This fix allows users to address this problem by changing the settings for their ECID cookies.<br>Currently, Analytics sets Experience Cloud ID Service (ECID) cookies with the setting `SameSite = Lax` which, prior to version 80 of Chrome, allowed cross-domain tracking. This is no longer the case. This change allows users to update the SameSite setting for ECID cookies to `None`.<br>Note that this allows the Analytics cookie to be shared in more situations, but Analytics cookies do not contain sensitive information. In addition, when choosing this setting, cookies must be set to `Secure` so that data can be passed only via HTTPS connections. If you would like to make this change, please have a supported user open a ticket with Customer Care. |
| Migration from `omniture.com` to `adobe.com` domain | Aug. 21, 2020 | On August 13, 2020, Adobe Analytics migrated its frontend architecture from `omniture.com|http://omniture.com/` to the `adobe.com|http://adobe.com/` domain. This change should mitigate third-party cookie issues that arose after the initial May 28, 2020 unified product domain change. As a result of this update, the browser may prompt users to trust the new an `.adobe.com|http://an.adobe.com/` or `experience.adobe.com|http://experience.adobe.com/` domain. |
| Update on Ad Hoc Analysis Java 8 compatibility | Aug. 21, 2020 | Ad Hoc Analysis is not currently compatible with Java 8 versions 1.8.0_261+. To ensure that your access to this tool is not disrupted before the [end-of-life date](https://spark.adobe.com/page/S9Bhp66VJ2fEn/) is reached, we recommend that you maintain a Java 8 version prior to 1.8.0_261. |
| EOL of Adobe Data Connectors | July 13, 2020 | Adobe [!UICONTROL Data Connectors] are powered by legacy technology that is no longer viable or supported. We have a new standard in the [Adobe Exchange Partner Program](https://partners.adobe.com/exchangeprogram/experiencecloud) that should be adopted for any integrations that wish to continue to be offered and supported. The official end-of-life date is still to be determined, but we anticipate it to be in the next 12-18 months (mid 2021 to end of 2021). [Learn more...](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/import/dataconnectors/data-connectors-eol.html) |
| EOL of Ad Hoc Analysis | Aug. 6, 2018 | Adobe announced the intention to end-of-life Ad Hoc Analysis on March 1, 2021. For more information, visit [Discover Workspace](https://spark.adobe.com/page/S9Bhp66VJ2fEn/). |

### Self-Help

**[!DNL Experience Manager] Sites**

Rich Text Editor documentation is updated to list all [the supported protocols for links in RTE](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/administering/operations/configure-rich-text-editor-plug-ins.html#linkstyles).

**[!DNL Experience Manager] Assets**

* New help content on [how AEM Assets is accessible](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/assets/accessibility.html) for all users is available.

* **[Viewmode parameter](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/assets/using/search-assets.html#assetpicker)** is added to asset selector (asset picker) to open the asset selector in search mode. To open asset selector in search mode and use with `assettype` and `mimetype`, user needs to suffix the `viewmode=search` parameter in the url `https://[aem-server]:[port]/aem/assetpicker.html`. For example, `https://[aem-server]:[port]/aem/assetpicker.html?viewmode=search&assettype=images`.

* The associated user groups of private folder are removed on the [deletion of the private folder](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/assets/managing/private-folder.html#delete-private-folder), and existing redundant, unused, and auto-generated user groups can be cleaned up from the repository using clean method in JMX.

* The desktop app login issue with [service pack 6.5.5.0](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/release-notes/service-pack/previous-hotfixes-featurepacks.html#assets-6550) has been fixed with desktop app version 2.0.3.2.

* If users have modified [Apache Jackrabbit Oak TokenConfiguration](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/kb/How-to-set-token-session-expiration-AEM.html) to set the timeout configuration to be less than the time it takes for an asset to upload, then user can encounter session timeout situation.Users, therefore, need to change the `chunkUploadMinFileSize` and `chunksize`, so that each chunk request refreshes the session. For more information, see [upload assets](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/assets/managing/managing-assets-touch-ui.html#uploading-assets).

* Assets can be [moved in to sibling folders using drag operation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/assets/managing/managing-assets-touch-ui.html#moving-or-renaming-assets) also, apart from [!UICONTROL Move(m)] operation that opens [!UICONTROL Move Assets] wizard.

* For Assets Insights, use [Adobe Launch](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/assets/advanced/asset-insights-launch-tutorial.html). [DTM integration](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/assets/managing/touch-ui-using-dtm-for-asset-insights.html) is called out as a deprecated method in the docs.

Updated: **10/28/2020**

## Experience Cloud interface and core services {#ecloud}

New features and fixes in the Experience Cloud interface, including administration and core services (customer attributes, audiences, triggers, cookies, and so on).

### Unified product domain

Adobe is updating the domain and interface header to unify and improve your experience across all Experience Cloud applications. These enhancements are designed to simplify your experience in small but important ways. These enhancements will not change your current workflows.

Updates include:

* New solution URLs: `experience.adobe.com/<application name>`:
    * All products will eventually adopt this URL pattern. Look for new URLs to become effective throughout the month. 
    * Browser support: Supported browsers include [!DNL Microsoft® Edge], [!DNL Google Chrome], [!DNL Firefox], [!DNL Safari], and [!DNL Opera] (latest versions). **Note:** Although the Experience Cloud interface supports these browsers, individual solutions might not support every browser. (For example, [Analytics](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/admin/sys-reqs.html?lang=en) does not support [!DNL Opera], and [Target](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/implement-target/before-implement/supported-browsers.html?lang=en) does not support [!DNL Safari].) 
    * ([!DNL Safari] only) The domain change may cause cookie issues in [!DNL Safari]. Unchecking _Prevent cross-site tracking_ in the [!DNL Safari] Privacy Preferences enables cookies across domains (and all cross-site experiences), and allows Experience Cloud to function on this new domain. 
* Easier switching between your organizations or to a different application.
* Improved product help: [!UICONTROL Experience League] is integrated into the product so that a help search also includes results from community forums and video content. This change simplifies access to more content and helps you get the most out of Experience Cloud. Additionally, select **[!UICONTROL Help]** > **[!UICONTROL Feedback]** to report issues or share your ideas with Adobe.  
* Improved notifications: The [!UICONTROL Notifications] drop-down menu now has two tabs, one for your own product notifications and one for global product announcements.

**Note:** The [!UICONTROL Feed] page is being deprecated in January, 2020. Look for an in-product deprecation notice.

For product documentation, see [Experience Cloud](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/core-services/interface/experience-cloud.html?lang=en).

### Experience Cloud cookies

Adobe is adjusting the `same-site` setting on cookies to prepare for changes Chrome makes in Chrome 80 (to be released in February 2020).

You do not need to make changes unless you use a CNAME for 1st-party data collection but use that CNAME across multiple domains (friendly 3rd-party domains), and you do not use the Experience Cloud (Visitor) ID Service. With the Chrome 80 release, Chrome automatically gives the Analytics visitor ID cookies a SameSite value of `Lax,` which prevents their use on your other domains. If you want to continue using your CNAME across your domains, you must contact Adobe Customer Care and request that they change the SameSite value for your CNAME to `None.`

Note that Adobe recommends that you use a separate CNAME for each of your domains, whether or not you are using the Experience Cloud ID Service.

## Mobile Services and Mobile SDKs {#mobile}

* [New features, enhancements, and fixes in Adobe Analytics](#aa-features)
* [Important notices for Analytics administrators](#aa-notices)
* [AppMeasurement](#appm)

For product documentation, see [Adobe Analytics Help Home](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics.html?lang=en).

### New features, enhancements, and fixes in Adobe Analytics {#aa-features}

| Feature    | Description  |
| -----------| ---------- | 
|Analysis Workspace – Freeform Table Builder |With Table Builder enabled, you can drag and drop in many dimensions, breakdowns, metrics and segments to build tables that answer more complex business questions. Data will not update immediately. Instead, updates occur after you select **[!UICONTROL Build]**, saving you time once you know what table you want to construct. Additionally, this feature offers:<ul><li>**Preview**: You can preview the format of a table before spending time to render real data.</li><li>**Flexible Row and breakdown settings**: You can set your row and breakdown levels for every dimension row. Previously, Workspace imposed defaults that could not be changed until after the data was returned.</li><li>**Breakdown by position**: You can set dimension rows to always _breakdown by position_ instead of _by specific item_ (the default).</li><li>**Manual static row ordering**: You can manually order static rows so that the table rows are displayed exactly as you need them. Previously, static rows could be sorted only by a metric column or alphabetically.</li></ul>Associated documentation will be published when this feature releases later in January.|
|New [!UICONTROL Identified State] dimension for Cross-Device Analytics (CDA)|We are adding a new dimension called [!UICONTROL Identified State] to CDA virtual report suites. The dimension has two possible values, _Identified_ and _Unidentified_. _Identified_ means that the person has been identified by the device graph. _Unidentified_ means that the person has not been identified by the device graph.<br>This means that CDA users can now create calculated metrics, such as [!UICONTROL Device Graph Coverage], which describes how many of the people within the virtual report suite are known by the device graph. This metric is helpful for troubleshooting CDA compression rates. If few people are identified, the level of stitching will be low.|
|VRS Support in Data Warehouse API|Virtual Report Suites will now be available for use via the Data Warehouse API. Previously, they were only available via the Data Warehouse UI. When using the Data Warehouse API, you can now see and query virtual report suites, but only if the segments applied to a Virtual Report Suite are compatible with Data Warehouse.|
|Privacy Service API: CCPA|The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) enhances privacy rights and consumer protection for residents of California, United States. This Act became effective on January 1, 2020.<br><br/>The CCPA provides new data privacy rights to California residents, such as the right to access and delete their personal data, to know whether their personal data is sold or disclosed (and to whom), and to refuse the sale of their personal data.<br><br/>The Privacy Service supports requests to opt out from the selling of personal data.<br><br/>The Privacy Service was formerly the GDPR Service and retains all the previous functionality, now extended to support CCPA.<br/><br/>[CCPA in Analytics](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/admin/data-governance/an-ccpa-overview.html?lang=en)<br><br/>[Privacy Service Overview](https://www.adobe.com/go/privacy-overview-en)|

#### Fixes

* Fixed an issue with alert notifications not being delivered to phone numbers in Egypt. (AN-197079)
* Fixed multiple issues with the [!DNL DFA Data Connector]. (AN-193281, AN-193075, AN-193484, AN-193737)
* [!UICONTROL Reports & Analytics]: Fixed an issue with the Product Conversion Funnel report getting cut off and showing unclear numbers. (AN-186901)
* Fixed an issue that prevented users from switching report suites in Workspace projects that were based on report suites with the new Classifications architecture. (AN-199076)
* Fixed an issue that prevented the [!UICONTROL Cumulative] function in [!UICONTROL Calculated Metrics] from working properly. (AN-184257)

### Important notices for [!DNL Analytics] administrators {#aa-notices}

|New Adobe Analytics domain|Dec. 18, 2019|On January 16, 2020, Adobe Analytics will begin moving to a new domain - `https://experience.adobe.com/analytics.`<br>**Note**: This change applies to all users accessing Analytics with their Adobe ID or Enterprise ID. <ul><li>The domain change may cause cookie issues when loading Analytics in Safari.

You can use other browsers without issue because this affects only Safari users.</li><li>The domain change may cause [!UICONTROL Activity Map] to stop working for some customers [in specific cases](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/activity-map/activity-map.html?lang=en).</li></ul>|

### New features, enhancements, and fixes in Audience Manager {#aam-features}

| Feature    | Description  |
| -----------| ---------- |
|[California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) Support and Privacy Documentation Overhaul](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/overview/data-privacy/data-privacy.html?lang=en) | The [California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)](https://www.caprivacy.org/about), which came into effect on January 1st, 2020, provides California residents new rights regarding their personal information and impose data protection responsibilities on certain entities that conduct business in California. <br><br> Audience Manager helps you comply with your obligations under privacy regulations, through privacy tools like the [Adobe Experience Platform Privacy Service](https://www.adobe.com/go/privacy-overview-en) for data access and delete requests. <br><br> We have updated the current [opt-out management](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/overview/data-privacy/data-privacy-requests.html?lang=en) process to include opting out of any declared ID (e.g. CRM ID). In case of opt-out by declared ID, the declared ID and the last linked device will be opted out of Audience Manager data collection. Opt-out requests now also send unsegment requests to [destination partners](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/overview/data-privacy/data-privacy-requests.html?lang=en) who support this feature, both in batch and real time. <br><br> Also, we've redesigned our [Data Security](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/overview/data-security.html?lang=en), [Data Privacy](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/overview/data-privacy/data-privacy.html?lang=en), and [Data Governance](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/overview/data-governance.html?lang=en) documentation, to make it easier for you to find the information required to comply with the previously mentioned regulations.|

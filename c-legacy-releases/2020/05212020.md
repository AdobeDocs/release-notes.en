## ![Icon](/assets/adobe.png) Adobe System Status {#status}

[!UICONTROL Adobe System Status] provides detailed information, status updates, and email notifications about Adobe cloud products and services outage, disruption, and maintenance events. Check it out at [status.adobe.com](https://status.adobe.com/).

Release date: **May 21, 2020**

**What's new**

* Using your Adobe ID, you can subscribe to event notifications with more granularity, down to the product offering and add-on level. To help you setup your subscription faster, the self-subscription process now recommends a selection of products and offerings based on your product entitlements. This should reduce the number of emails you receive, and deliver more relevant notifications in your inbox. Get started at [status.adobe.com/subscriptions](https://status.adobe.com/proactive-notifications/subscriptions/edit).

**New features and enhancements available today**

| Feature    | Description  |
| -----------| ---------- |
|Improved subscription and notification user experience | <ul><li>[!DNL Marketo Engage] regional locations are now filtered based on the list of product offerings selected.</li><li>[!DNL Marketo Engage] email notifications are relevant to the user's region, location, and environment preferences.</li></ul> |
|Event subscription confirmation| <ul><li>You can now get an email confirmation when subscribing to on-going single event updates.</li></ul> |
|Global navigation usability enhancements | <ul><li>Consistent user experience with `Adobe.com` at the top level navigation menu.</li></ul>|

## ![Icon](/assets/ec_appicon_24.png) Experience Cloud interface {#ecloud}

General updates to the Experience Cloud interface.

**Unified product domain**

Adobe has been updating the domain and interface header to unify and improve your experience across all Experience Cloud applications. These enhancements are designed to simplify your experience in small but important ways. These enhancements do not change your current workflows.

Updates include:

* New application URLs: `experience.adobe.com/<application name>`:
  * All products will eventually adopt this URL pattern. Look for new URLs to become effective throughout the month.
  * Browser support: Supported browsers include [!DNL Microsoft Edge], [!DNL Google Chrome], [!DNL Firefox], [!DNL Safari], and [!DNL Opera] (latest versions). **Note:** Although the Experience Cloud interface supports these browsers, individual applications might not support every browser. (For example, [Analytics](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/admin/sys-reqs.html) does not support [!DNL Opera], and [Target](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/implement-target/before-implement/supported-browsers.html) does not support [!DNL Safari].)
  * ([!DNL Safari] only) The domain change may cause cookie issues in [!DNL Safari]. Deselecting _Prevent cross-site tracking_ in the [!DNL Safari] Privacy Preferences enables cookies across domains (and all cross-site experiences), and allows Experience Cloud to function on this new domain.
* Easier switching between your organizations or to a different application.
* Improved product help: [!UICONTROL Experience League] is integrated into the product so that a help search also includes results from community forums and video content. This change simplifies access to more content and helps you get the most out of Experience Cloud. Additionally, select **[!UICONTROL Help]** > **[!UICONTROL Feedback]** to report issues or share your ideas with Adobe.

The following apps use the new experience.adobe.com domain:

| App or Service    | Domain  |
| -----------| ---------- |
|Experience Cloud home page | `experience.adobe.com/home`|
|Adobe Target |`experience.adobe.com/target` |
|Adobe Audience Manager |`experience.adobe.com/audience-manager` |
|Adobe Launch |`experience.adobe.com/launch` |
|Adobe Experience Platform |`experience.adobe.com/platform` |
|Journey Management |`experience.adobe.com/journeys` |
|Customer Journey Analytics |`experience.adobe.com/platform/analytics` |
|Adobe Campaign Control Panel |`experience.adobe.com/controlpanel` |
|Cloud Manager |`experience.adobe.com/cloud-manager` |
|Places Service |`experience.adobe.com/places` |
|Software Distribution |`experience.adobe.com/downloads` |
|Admin Tool (beta)  |`experience.adobe.com/admin` |

>[!NOTE]
>
>**[!UICONTROL Board & Collections]**, a legacy filter in [!UICONTROL Marketing Cloud Assets] selector, is being decommissioned.

#### New features in [!UICONTROL Media Analytics] {#media-aa}

Date updated: **May 29, 2020**

**Player State Tracking:** [!UICONTROL Media Analytics] customers can capture viewer interaction during playback using a standard set of solution variables for full screen, closed captioning, mute, picture-in-picture, and in-focus. You also have the flexibility to create custom player states. Player State Tracking variables are now available for reporting in [!UICONTROL Analysis Workspace]. This feature requires one of the following:

* Media [!DNL JavaScript] SDK 3.0 or higher
* For use with the [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] (AEP) SDK:
  * [!UICONTROL Media Analytics Extension] (for web): [!UICONTROL Adobe Media Analytics] (3.x SDK) for Audio and Video v1.0 or higher
  * [!UICONTROL Media Analytics Extension] (for mobile): [!UICONTROL Adobe Media Analytics for Audio] and Video v2.0 or higher
* [!UICONTROL Media Collection]

See [About Player State Tracking](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/media-analytics/using/player-state-tracking/player-state-overview.html).

#### Adobe Analytics fixes {#aa-fixes}

* Adobe changed the [!UICONTROL Time Spent] metric to never include "Unspecified" in the calculation. This means that, regardless of whether the UI says to include "Unspecified", we make a special exception to always exclude "Unspecified" in the [!UICONTROL Time Spent] calculation. Therefore, even if you configured a report containing the [!UICONTROL Time Spent] metric to include "Unspecified", it will always return 0 time spent for the "Unspecified" line item. Note that this may change historical reporting in Reports & Analytics as well as the Reporting API v1.4. (AN-197958)
* Fixed an issue in which the Instance/Visit/Visitor wasn't being counted in the denominator for the [!UICONTROL Time Spent] metrics.  This would happen when a hit with no value for the dimension (e.g., [!UICONTROL Pagename]) mfollowed in the same second. (AN-211074)
* Fixed an issue that caused missing [!DNL Analytics] segment data in Audience Manager. (AN-206221)
* Fixed an issue with [!UICONTROL Data Sources] processing showing the wrong dates. (AN-213604)

* Fixed an issue with being unable to copy [!UICONTROL Product Profile] permissions. (AN-211113)
* Fixed an issue where users with Federated IDs were not able to log in to [!UICONTROL Report Builder]. (AN-207750)
* Fixed an issue with [!UICONTROL AdWords] data not showing in [!UICONTROL Advertising Analytics]. (AN-213249)
* Fixed an issue where classification data did not display in the trended view. (AN-212761)
* Fixed an issue that caused an incorrect published segment count in the [!UICONTROL Segment Manager]. (AN-213374)
* Fixed an issue with the **[!UICONTROL Show Upwards Trend As...]** option in the [!UICONTROL Calculated Metric Editor] â€“ it did not work when applying filters. (AN-214223)
* Fixed multiple issues with [!UICONTROL Classification] Import and Export. (AN-213488, AN-215309, AN-216345, AN-215307, AN-216671)
* Fixed multiple issues with [!UICONTROL Classification Rule Builder]. (AN-213826, AN-213550, AN-213095)
* Fixed issues with [!UICONTROL Data Sources] processing. (AN-218083, AN-213604, AN-214102, AN-215485, AN-215339, AN-212911, AN-217551, AN-217947, AN-219018, AN-214691, AN-218401)
* Fixed FTP connectivity issues. (AN-115525)
* Fixed multiple [!DNL Analytics] [!UICONTROL Data Feeds] issues. (AN-176769, AN-160480, AN-211923, AN-204286, AN-212977, AN-214528, AN-215080, AN-217784, AN-219093, AN-218817, AN-217798, AN-218267, AN-218382)
* Fixed issues with [!UICONTROL Data Warehouse] requests. (AN-181836)
* Fixed issues in PDF downloaded [!UICONTROL Workspace] projects, where values were converted into special characters. (AN-196153)
* Fixed an issue with being unable to copy [!UICONTROL Product Profile] permissions in [!UICONTROL Admin Console]. (AN-211113)
* Fixed an issue where time formats in calculated metrics were broken for negative values. (AN-210900)
* Fixed an issue that prevented users from changing the [!UICONTROL Attribution Model] on static row metrics. (AN-207872)

* Fixed an issue that happened when changing the date range in [!UICONTROL Workspace] and selecting **[!UICONTROL Apply to all panels]**. The date did not change in some panels. (AN-214944)
* Fixed an issue with not being able to create or edit alerts. (AN-215920)
* Fixed an issue with all dynamic date ranges in [!UICONTROL Workspace] showing incorrect dates due to the first day of the week sporadically switching to a Sunday from a Monday. (AN-218835)

### Important notices for [!DNL Analytics] administrators {#aa-notices}

| Notice | Date Added or Updated  | Description |
| -----------| ---------- | ---------- |
|Migration to unified product domain|Effective date: May 28, 2020|The migration to a unified product domain for Adobe Analytics, which began in January 2020, completed on May 28, 2020. While Adobe Analytics works to remove all `omniture.com` domain references from its architecture, it is important to allow `omniture.com` as a third-party cookie. When the full architecture migration is (soon) completed, we will notify you via the release notes and this allowlist step will no longer be needed. [Here](https://helpx.adobe.com/analytics/kb/adobe-ip-addresses.html) is a full list of recommended IP addresses and domains that you should allow.<br>If your organization blocks third-party cookies, please reach out to Customer Care to regain your access to Adobe Analytics.|
|New Adobe Analytics default landing page|Effective Date: June 18, 2020|On June 18, 2020, the default landing page for Adobe Analytics will change from [!UICONTROL Reports] to [!UICONTROL Workspace]. This change will occur for any users who have not previously set a custom landing page.|
|Change to how [!UICONTROL Entries/Exits] are calculated in [!UICONTROL Workspace]|April 7, 2020|In [!UICONTROL Analysis Workspace], as of March 2020, we have changed how the _None_ value interacts with [!UICONTROL Entries/Exits]. Because you can now turn _Nones_ on and off in [!UICONTROL Analysis Workspace], we apply the _None_ value after the entry or exit, whereas (for eVars) it used to be applied before entry or exit. For example, assume that the first hit of a visit has no value for eVars, but the second hit does. In [!UICONTROL Reports & Analytics] the first hit will show as _Unspecified_ for the Entry, but in [!UICONTROL Analysis Workspace] it will show up as the value on the second hit.|
|EOL of **[!UICONTROL Conversion Level]** setting|March 3, 2020|The non-functioning [Conversion Level](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/admin/admin-tools/general-acct-settings-admin.html) setting in **[!UICONTROL Admin Tools]** > **[!UICONTROL Report Suites]** > **[!UICONTROL General Account Settings]** will be removed from the interface on March 12, 2020.|
|EOL of **[!UICONTROL Dashboard Archive]**|March 27, 2020|The **[!UICONTROL View Archive]** setting under **[!UICONTROL Manage Dashboards]** in [!UICONTROL Reports & Analytics] will no longer be available as of October, 2020.|
|End of Support for TLS 1.1 | October 3, 2019 | By March 31, 2020, Adobe Analytics will remove support for TLS 1.1. This change is part of our ongoing efforts to maintain the highest security standards and promote the safety of customer data.|
|New Adobe Analytics domain|Dec. 18, 2019|On January 16, 2020, Adobe Analytics began moving to a new domain - `https://experience.adobe.com/analytics.`<br>**Note:** This change applies to all users accessing Analytics with their Adobe ID or Enterprise ID. <ul><li>The domain change may cause cookie issues when loading Analytics in Safari. Deselecting _Prevent cross-site tracking_ in the [!DNL Safari] Privacy Preferences enables cookies across domains (and all cross-site experiences), and allows Analytics to function on this new Adobe Experience Cloud domain. You can use other browsers without issue because this affects only [!DNL Safari] users.</li><li>The domain change may cause [!UICONTROL Activity Map] to stop working for some customers [in specific cases](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/activity-map/activity-map.html).</li></ul>|
|End of Life - Analytics Legacy APIs|January 9, 2020|In November 2020, the following Analytics Legacy API services will reach their end-of-life and will be shutdown. Current integrations built using these services will stop working. <ul><li>1.3 Analytics APIs</li><li>1.4 SOAP Analytics APIs</li><li>Legacy OAuth Authentication (OAuth and JWT)</li></ul>We have provided a [Legacy API EOL FAQ](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-1.4-apis/blob/master/docs/APIEOL.md?mv=email) to help answer your questions and provide guidance on how to proceed. API integrations that employ these services can migrate to the [1.4 Analytics REST APIs](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-1.4-apis?mv=email) or the [2.0 Analytics APIs](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-2.0-apis?mv=email). Legacy OAuth accounts can migrate to an [Adobe IO](https://console.adobe.io/home?mv=email) Analytics integration account, which can be used to access both the 1.4 Analytics APIs and 2.0 Analytics APIs.|
|San Jose FTP Broker Ending for London and Singapore|July 2020|For customers in London and Singapore, we will no longer support brokering of data between London or Singapore and the San Jose data center [ftp.omniture.com](ftp://ftp.omniture.com/).<br/><ul><li>For London, use [ftp3.omniture.com](ftp://ftp3.omniture.com/)</li><li>For Singapore, use [ftp4.omniture.com](ftp://ftp4.omniture.com/)</li></ul>|
|EOL of Ad Hoc Analysis|Aug 6, 2018|Adobe announced the intention to end-of-life Ad Hoc Analysis. An end-of-life date will be shared once available. For more information, visit [Discover Workspace](https://spark.adobe.com/page/S9Bhp66VJ2fEn/).|

* Fixed an issue where customers that are not using the [!UICONTROL Audience Marketplace] anymore were receiving monthly invoicing emails. (AAM-54602)

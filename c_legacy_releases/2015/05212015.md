## Audience Manager

|  Feature  | Description  |
|---|---|
|  [Audience Marketplace](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/c_audience_marketplace.html)  | [!DNL  Audience Marketplace] provides specialized features that lets data buyers and data providers execute data deals in a self-service manner with minimum effort. Talk to your [!DNL  Audience Manager] consultant to get started. They can activate [!DNL  Audience Marketplace] for you.  |

**Fixes, Enhancements, and Deprecations** 

* [Create Groups](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/t_create_groups.html): Simplified steps and directions for creating groups and assigning permissions.
* [Understanding Wild Card Permissions](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/c_wildcard_permissions.html): Use [!DNL  Wild Card Permissions] to give group members access to new data sources automatically. With standard permissions, you must manually assign new data sources to a group.

**Known Issues** 

In the VisitorAPI / AppMeasurement Audience Manager Module integrations, there will be two destination publishing iFrame requests made in IE6-9: [!DNL  //fast.<subdomain>.demdex.net/dest5.html] and [!DNL  //fast.<subdomain>.demdex.net/dest4.html]. The correct behavior, as seen in other browsers, is to only load [!DNL  //fast.<subdomain>.demdex.net/dest5.html].

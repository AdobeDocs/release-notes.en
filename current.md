    _New features in Experience Manager Assets prerelease channel_

  * **Cloud Manager**

    _New features_

### New features in [!DNL Advertising Cloud DSP] {#adcloud-dsp}

Last updated: **October 27, 2021**

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Custom Reports | You can now create and manage [!DNL Amazon S3] and different types of FTP delivery locations, called *[!DNL report destinations]*, for your custom reports. Once you configure report destinations, you can set up each of your new custom reports to be delivered to one or more locations of a single destination type, or to email recipients. Updates to your [!DNL Amazon S3] and FTP credentials won't interrupt report delivery.<br><br>Your existing reports are still sent to the specified email recipients. To configure delivery to a different report destination, create a report with the new destination. |
| [!UICONTROL Packages], [!UICONTROL Placements], and [!UICONTROL Ads] views| When you view data for a single day, the trend charts now include hourly data. Hold the cursor over any point to see the data for that hour. |
| [!UICONTROL Placements] | The placement [!UICONTROL Inspector] now includes an [!UICONTROL Inventory] tab, which shows all deals and their associated metrics for the placement. Use the information to make quick adjustments or troubleshoot issues without generating a custom report. |
| [!UICONTROL Ads] | (Users with permission to include Clearcastclock numbers in their ads) DSP no longer shows an error if you use a clock number that's attached to another ad. **Note:**  The best practice is to use a unique clock number for each video ad. Otherwise, the publisher does not approve all the ads. |
| [!UICONTROL Deal IDs] | The [!UICONTROL Deal ID] settings and other places in the user interface reflect new branding for [!DNL Magnite] SSP:<br><ul><li>The SSP [!DNL Tremor] ([!DNL Telaria]) is now [!DNL Magnite CTV].</li><li>In the coming weeks, [!DNL Rubicon] will change to [!DNL Magnite DV+], where [!DNL DV+] stands for display, video, and other formats such as audio.</li></ul> |
| [!DNL Freewheel] programmatically guaranteed deals | You can now find the status of ads for [!DNL Freewheel] programmatically guaranteed deals from the [!UICONTROL Ads] view. Previously, you could check the status only from the [!UICONTROL Deals] view. |

{style="table-layout:auto"}

### New features in [!DNL Advertising Cloud Search] {#adcloud-search}

Last updated: **October 7, 2021**

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [!UICONTROL Reports], [!UICONTROL Notification Center] | (October 9 release) All email notifications for reports, which Advertising Cloud Search sends when a custom or scheduled report has completed or failed, are now handled by [!UICONTROL Notification Center]. Email notifications and web notifications are enabled by default for reports, but you can optionally change the notification settings. With this change:<ul><li>Email recipients are restricted to users who are registered, authenticated users of Advertising Cloud Search and have access to the advertiser account. This feature ensures that no confidential data is sent to unauthorized users.</li><li>The format and contents of the email uses the [!UICONTROL Notification Center] template, which includes more details of the report and includes direct download links for all report formats.</li><li>Report notifications are a new notification type, with its own notification preferences, in [!UICONTROL Notification Center].</li></ul>If you use any automation to pull reports from email notifications, you may need to update the filtering logic to ensure process continuity. |
| Advertising Insights | Additional insights are available in beta mode. |

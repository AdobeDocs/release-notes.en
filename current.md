As of March 25, 2021, new imports of this type can no longer be created. Please use [Bulk Data Insertion API](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experiencecloud/analytics/docs.html#!AdobeDocs/analytics-2.0-apis/master/bdia.md) to import this type of data. |
|Sign in update to [!UICONTROL Report Builder] | April 9, 2021 | On January 14, 2021, the [!UICONTROL Report Builder] sign-in updates removed dependencies on legacy technologies and aligned the sign-in process with Experience Cloud.

Report Builder version 5.6.47 and later supports only the Experience Cloud sign-in and will not support single sign-on.|
| Data Feed and Data Warehouse IP Address Changes | April 6, 2021 | Starting June 17, the Data Feeds and Data Warehouse delivery system will be relocated within Adobe's data centers, and therefore can cause a change of external IP addresses visible to you. Adobe recommends that you confirm that all the IP CIDR blocks for the data center where your reports and feeds are sourced are present in firewalls for destination systems that you control. [Here is a full list of IP Address ranges to place into your firewall’s allow lists](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/technotes/ip-addresses.html#data-collection-and-ftp-ip-address-blocks). |

All of these pages will still be available under the **[!UICONTROL All Components]**, **[!UICONTROL All Tools]**, and **[!UICONTROL All Admin]** links - they will be removed from the dropdown menu. Here are the menu items that will be removed from the dropdown menu and placed on their respective link page:<br><br> [!UICONTROL Components]<ul><li>[!UICONTROL Bookmarks]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Dashboards]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Targets]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Calendar Events]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Scheduled Reports]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Report Settings]</li></ul>[!UICONTROL Tools]<ul><li>[!UICONTROL Recommendations Classic]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Search & Promote]</li></ul>[!UICONTROL Admin]<ul><li>[!UICONTROL User Management]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Classification Importer]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Classification Rule Builder]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Data Sources]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Data Connectors]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Company Settings]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Logs]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Dynamic Tag Management]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Code Manager]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Exclude by IP]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Traffic Management]</li></ul> |
| Same-as-SiteCatalyst VISTA Processing ON | March 17, 2021 | On June 17, 2021, all report suites will be updated to have [!UICONTROL Same-as-SiteCatalyst VISTA Processing] set to ON. This change impacts Data Warehouse reporting by processing the data to match processing rules. For questions or clarification, reach out to Customer Care. |
| Reports & Analytics landing page options | February 19, 2021 | On March 25, 2021, options to set new Reports & Analytics dashboards or other content as your Adobe Analytics landing page were removed.

| End-of-life for three Analytics API services | January 6, 2021 | On April 30, 2021, the following Analytics Legacy API services reached their end-of-life date and were shut down. Any current integrations built using these services stopped working on that day.<ul><li>1.3 Analytics APIs</li><li>1.4 SOAP Analytics APIs</li><li>Legacy OAuth Authentication (OAuth and JWT)</li></ul>We have provided a [Legacy API EOL FAQ](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-1.4-apis/blob/master/docs/APIEOL.md?mv=email) to help answer your questions and provide guidance on how to proceed. API integrations that employ these services can migrate to the [1.4 Analytics REST APIs](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-1.4-apis?mv=email) or the [2.0 Analytics APIs](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-2.0-apis?mv=email). Legacy OAuth accounts can migrate to an [Adobe I/O](https://console.adobe.io/home?mv=email#) Analytics integration account, which can be used to access both the 1.4 Analytics APIs and 2.0 Analytics APIs. |
| EOL of Adobe Data Connectors | July 13, 2020 | Adobe [!UICONTROL Data Connectors] are powered by legacy technology that is no longer viable or supported. A new standard is available in the [Adobe Exchange Partner Program](https://partners.adobe.com/exchangeprogram/experiencecloud).

  * **Experience Manager Assets as a Cloud Service**

    * Experience Manager does not archive single asset downloads where the original file is downloaded. This enhancement allows for faster downloads.
    * When an asset is downloaded by way of the link share option, you can now choose to download or not download the renditions. Previously, all the asset renditions were downloaded.
    * Administrators can configure Experience Manager to delete the source of assets after doing a bulk asset ingestion. See [bulk asset ingestion](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/assets/manage/add-assets.html?lang=en#asset-bulk-ingestor).
    * When executing a health check to import assets in bulk, Experience Manager now provides more information reasons for failures. See [bulk asset ingestion](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/assets/manage/add-assets.html?lang=en#asset-bulk-ingestor).
    * When importing assets using bulk import tool, administrators now can optionally delete the source files after the import is successful. See [bulk asset ingestion](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/assets/manage/add-assets.html?lang=en#asset-bulk-ingestor).

    * Metadata of many assets can be imported in bulk using a CSV file and can be exported to a CSV file. The default date format is now `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSXXX`. Users can apply a different format by updating the column header. For example, add Date: `DateFormat: yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssXXX` as the column header in the CSV file instead of the word Date.
    * When browsing assets in Column view, a visual indicator displays the approved or rejected status of each asset.
    * When browsing assets in Column view, a visual indicator displays for expired assets.
    * A text area data type is made available in Assets metadata editor. You can use this option to let your users input metadata in a free-form text field.

The service can also convert your existing PDF forms to digital forms. In addition to standard AEM Forms features, the service offers several cloud-native capabilities like auto-scaling, zero downtime for upgrades, and cloud-native development environment. To learn about capabilities and features of Experience Manager Forms as a Cloud Service, read this blog page [Future of Work: Experience Manager Forms as a Cloud Service](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2021/03/11/experience-manager-forms-as-a-cloud-service.html).

It instructs the recipient to [upload the image of a government-issued identity document (driver’s license, national ID, passport)](https://helpx.adobe.com/in/sign/using/adobesign-authentication-government-id.html). Then it evaluates that document to ensure it is authentic.

    * **Support to use in-form signing experience for asynchronous adaptive form submissions**

      You can now use the in-form signing experience for asynchronous adaptive form submissions. You can also embed an adaptive form in an Experience Manager Sites page and use the in-form signing experience for adaptive form submissions.

    * **Support to use a variable to specify an attachment while prepopulating an Adaptive Form for an Assign Task step**

      While prepopulating an Adaptive Form for an Assign Task step, you can now use a document type variable to select an input attachment for the Adaptive Form.

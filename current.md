## ![Icon](/assets/adobe.png) Adobe System Status {#status}

[!UICONTROL Adobe System Status] provides detailed information, status updates, and email notifications about Adobe cloud products and services outage, disruption, and maintenance events. Check it out at [status.adobe.com](https://status.adobe.com/).

Released: **May 21, 2020**

**What's new**

* Using your Adobe ID, you can subscribe to event notifications with more granularity, down to the product offering and add-on level. To help you setup your subscription faster, the self-subscription process now recommends a selection of products and offerings based on your product entitlements. This should reduce the number of emails you receive, and deliver more relevant notifications in your inbox. Get started at [status.adobe.com/subscriptions](https://status.adobe.com/proactive-notifications/subscriptions/edit).

**New features and enhancements available today**

| Feature    | Description  |
| -----------| ---------- |
|Improved subscription and notification user experience | <ul><li>[!DNL Marketo Engage] regional locations are now filtered based on the list of product offerings selected.</li><li>[!DNL Marketo Engage] email notifications are relevant to the user's region, location, and environment preferences.</li></ul> |
|Event subscription confirmation| <ul><li>You can now get an email confirmation when subscribing to on-going single event updates.</li></ul> |
|Global navigation usability enhancements | <ul><li>Consistent user experience with `Adobe.com` at the top level navigation menu.</li></ul>|

## ![Icon](/assets/ec_appicon_24.png) Experience Cloud interface {#ecloud}

General updates to Experience Cloud interface.

**Updated interface menu**

In Experience Cloud, the **July 16, 2020** release updates the Application Switcher drop-down menu. It has been streamlined so that solution logos are removed, and the menu displays only the applications and services to which you have access.

See Experience Cloud interface [product documentation](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/core-services/interface/experience-cloud.html) for an example.

**Unified product domain**

Adobe has been updating the domain and interface header to unify and improve your experience across all Experience Cloud applications. These enhancements are designed to simplify your experience in small but important ways. These enhancements do not change your current workflows.

Updates include:

* New application URLs: `experience.adobe.com/<application name>`:
  * All products will eventually adopt this URL pattern. Look for new URLs to become effective throughout the month.
  * Browser support: Supported browsers include [!DNL Microsoft Edge], [!DNL Google Chrome], [!DNL Firefox], [!DNL Safari], and [!DNL Opera] (latest versions). **Note:** Although Experience Cloud interface supports these browsers, individual applications might not support every browser. (For example, [Analytics](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/admin/sys-reqs.html) does not support [!DNL Opera], and [Target](https://docs.adobe.com/help/en/target/using/implement-target/before-implement/supported-browsers.html) does not support [!DNL Safari].)
  * ([!DNL Safari] only) The domain change may cause cookie issues in [!DNL Safari]. Deselecting _Prevent cross-site tracking_ in the [!DNL Safari] Privacy Preferences enables cookies across domains (and all cross-site experiences), and allows Experience Cloud to function on this new domain.
* Easier switching between your organizations or to a different application.
* Improved product help: [!UICONTROL Experience League] is integrated into the product so that a help search also includes results from community forums and video content. This change simplifies access to more content and helps you get the most out of Experience Cloud. Additionally, click **[!UICONTROL Help]** > **[!UICONTROL Feedback]** to report issues or share your ideas with Adobe.

The following apps use the new experience.adobe.com domain:

| App or Service    | Domain  |
| -----------| ---------- |
|Experience Cloud home page | `experience.adobe.com/home`|
|Adobe Target |`experience.adobe.com/target` |
|Adobe Audience Manager |`experience.adobe.com/audience-manager` |
|Adobe Launch |`experience.adobe.com/launch` |
|Adobe Experience Platform |`experience.adobe.com/platform` |
|Journey Management |`experience.adobe.com/journeys` |
|Adobe Analytics|`experience.adobe.com/analytics`|
|Customer Journey Analytics |`experience.adobe.com/platform/analytics` |
|Adobe Campaign Control Panel |`experience.adobe.com/controlpanel` |
|Cloud Manager |`experience.adobe.com/cloud-manager` |
|Places Service |`experience.adobe.com/places` |
|Software Distribution |`experience.adobe.com/downloads` |
|Admin Tool (beta)  |`experience.adobe.com/admin` |

>[!NOTE]

### Important notices for [!DNL Analytics] administrators {#aa-notices}

| Notice | Date Added or Updated  | Description |
| -----------| ---------- | ---------- |
|End-of-life: Adobe Data Connectors|July 13, 2020|Adobe Data Connectors are powered by legacy technology that is no longer viable or supported. We have a new standard in the [Adobe Exchange Partner Program](https://partners.adobe.com/exchangeprogram/experiencecloud) that should be adopted for any integrations that wish to continue to be offered and supported. The official end-of-life date is still to be determined, but we anticipate it to be in the next 12-18 months (mid 2021 to end of 2021). [Learn more...](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/import/dataconnectors/data-connectors-eol.md)|
|Report suite mapping to IMS org | July 2020 | The report suite mapping tool will be discontinued in November 2020. This feature powers integrations such as Advertising Analytics and Experience Cloud segment publishing in Adobe Analytics. A report suite must be mapped to an IMS org to enable these and other services. Newer report suites are automatically mapped upon creation. However, older report suites must be manually mapped to an IMS org. See [Map report suites to an organization](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/core-services/interface/about-core-services/report-suite-mapping.html) in the Core Services user guide to make sure all report suites belong to an IMS org. |
|Migration to unified product domain|Effective date: May 28, 2020|The migration to a unified product domain for Adobe Analytics, which began in January 2020, completed on May 28, 2020. While Adobe Analytics works to remove all `omniture.com` domain references from its architecture, it is important to allowlist `omniture.com` as a third-party cookie. When the full architecture migration is (soon) completed, we will notify you via the release notes and this allowlist step will no longer be needed. [Here](https://helpx.adobe.com/analytics/kb/adobe-ip-addresses.html) is a full list of recommended IP addresses and domains that you should allowlist.<br>If your organization blocks third-party cookies, please reach out to Customer Care to regain your access to Adobe Analytics.|
|New Adobe Analytics default landing page|Effective Date: June 18, 2020|On June 18, 2020, the default landing page for Adobe Analytics will change from [!UICONTROL Reports] to [!UICONTROL Workspace]. This change will occur for any users who have not previously set a custom landing page.|
|Third-party technology allowlist|March 12, 2020 (effective date)|Adobe Analytics has begun leveraging third-party technologies for feature rollout management and in-product support. The following URLs should be added to any necessary network firewall allowlists to ensure full feature access:<ul><li>Gainsight: https://esp.aptrinsic.com</li><li>LaunchDarkly: https://app.launchdarkly.com</li></ul>|
|Improved redundancy for [!UICONTROL Analysis Workspace] availability|May 21, 2020|In order to ensure availability of [!UICONTROL Analysis Workspace], we are adding a secondary CDN (Content Delivery Network) for improved redundancy. The following URLs should be added to any necessary network firewall allowlists:<ul><li>https://aaui-879784980514.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws</li><li>https://d30ln29764hddd.cloudfront.net</li><li>https://awaascicdprodva7.blob.core.windows.net</li><li>https://aauicdnva7.azureedge.net</li></ul>|
|Change to how [!UICONTROL Entries/Exits] are calculated in [!UICONTROL Workspace]|April 7, 2020|In [!UICONTROL Analysis Workspace], as of March 2020, we have changed how the _None_ value interacts with [!UICONTROL Entries/Exits]. Because you can now turn _Nones_ on and off in [!UICONTROL Analysis Workspace], we apply the _None_ value after the entry or exit, whereas (for eVars) it used to be applied before entry or exit. For example, assume that the first hit of a visit has no value for eVars, but the second hit does. In [!UICONTROL Reports & Analytics] the first hit will show as _Unspecified_ for the Entry, but in [!UICONTROL Analysis Workspace] it will show up as the value on the second hit.|
|EOL of **[!UICONTROL Dashboard Archive]**|March 27, 2020|The **[!UICONTROL View Archive]** setting under **[!UICONTROL Manage Dashboards]** in [!UICONTROL Reports & Analytics] will no longer be available as of October, 2020.|
|End of Life - Analytics Legacy APIs|January 9, 2020|In November 2020, the following Analytics Legacy API services will reach their end-of-life and will be shutdown. Current integrations built using these services will stop working. <ul><li>1.3 Analytics APIs</li><li>1.4 SOAP Analytics APIs</li><li>Legacy OAuth Authentication (OAuth and JWT)</li></ul>We have provided a [Legacy API EOL FAQ](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-1.4-apis/blob/master/docs/APIEOL.md?mv=email) to help answer your questions and provide guidance on how to proceed. API integrations that employ these services can migrate to the [1.4 Analytics REST APIs](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-1.4-apis?mv=email) or the [2.0 Analytics APIs](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-2.0-apis?mv=email). Legacy OAuth accounts can migrate to an [Adobe IO](https://console.adobe.io/home?mv=email) Analytics integration account, which can be used to access both the 1.4 Analytics APIs and 2.0 Analytics APIs.|
|San Jose FTP Broker Ending for London and Singapore|July 2020|For customers in London and Singapore, we will no longer support brokering of data between London or Singapore and the San Jose data center [ftp.omniture.com](ftp://ftp.omniture.com/).<br/><ul><li>For London, use [ftp3.omniture.com](ftp://ftp3.omniture.com/)</li><li>For Singapore, use [ftp4.omniture.com](ftp://ftp4.omniture.com/)</li></ul>|
|EOL of Ad Hoc Analysis|Aug 6, 2018|Adobe announced the intention to end-of-life Ad Hoc Analysis. An end-of-life date will be shared once available. For more information, visit [Discover Workspace](https://spark.adobe.com/page/S9Bhp66VJ2fEn/).|

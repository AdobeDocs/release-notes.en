### Important notices for [!DNL Analytics] administrators {#aa-notices}

| Notice | Date Added or Updated  | Description |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| EOL of Ad Hoc Analysis | Jan. 2021 | [!UICONTROL Ad Hoc Analysis] reaches its end-of-life date on March 1, 2021. For more information, visit [Discover Workspace](https://spark.adobe.com/page/S9Bhp66VJ2fEn/). |
| End-of-life for three Analytics API services | January 6, 2021 | On April 30, 2021, the following Analytics Legacy API services are slated to reach their end-of-life date and will be shut down. Any current integrations built using these services will stop working on that day.<ul><li>1.3 Analytics APIs</li><li>1.4 SOAP Analytics APIs</li><li>Legacy OAuth Authentication (OAuth and JWT)</li></ul>We have provided a [Legacy API EOL FAQ](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-1.4-apis/blob/master/docs/APIEOL.md?mv=email) to help answer your questions and provide guidance on how to proceed. API integrations that employ these services can migrate to the [1.4 Analytics REST APIs](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-1.4-apis?mv=email) or the [2.0 Analytics APIs](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-2.0-apis?mv=email). Legacy OAuth accounts can migrate to an [Adobe IO](https://console.adobe.io/home?mv=email#) Analytics integration account, which can be used to access both the 1.4 Analytics APIs and 2.0 Analytics APIs. |
| EOL of Adobe Data Connectors | July 13, 2020 | Adobe [!UICONTROL Data Connectors] are powered by legacy technology that is no longer viable or supported. A new standard is available in the [Adobe Exchange Partner Program](https://partners.adobe.com/exchangeprogram/experiencecloud). You can use that standard for any integration to continue to be offered and supported. The official end-of-life date is August 1, 2021. [Learn more...](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/import/dataconnectors/data-connectors-eol.html) |
| Adding HSTS header to all incoming HTTPS requests | Sept. 29, 2020 | On Sept. 29, 2020, Adobe started adding the HSTS header to all incoming requests that use HTTPS. This header instructs the browser or client to make all future requests in HTTPS, which is a considered a security best practice. At this point, Adobe will not enforce this for incoming requests using HTTP. |
| Change to [!UICONTROL Experience Cloud ID Service] cookie setting | Sept. 22, 2020 | An update to the privacy settings for Chrome version 80 impacted the ability of Adobe Analytics to track some users viewing Google AMP pages. Specifically, it prevents cross-domain tracking of users viewing Google-hosted AMP pages. This could result in inflated counts of unique visitors. This fix allows users to address this problem by changing the settings for their ECID cookies.<br>Currently, Analytics sets [!UICONTROL Experience Cloud ID Service] (ECID) cookies with the setting `SameSite = Lax` which, prior to version 80 of Chrome, allowed cross-domain tracking. This is no longer the case. This change allows users to update the SameSite setting for ECID cookies to `None`.<br>This change allows the Analytics cookie to be shared in more situations, but Analytics cookies do not contain sensitive information. In addition, when choosing this setting, cookies must be set to `Secure` so that data can be passed only via HTTPS connections. If you would like to make this change, a supported user can open a ticket with Customer Care. |

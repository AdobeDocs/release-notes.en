### Important notices for [!DNL Analytics] administrators {#aa-notices}

| Notice | Date Added or Updated  | Description |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Browser user agents reflect incorrect operating system versions for macOS | May 19, 2021 | All major browsers currently report users of macOS X 11 and above incorrectly as using macOS 10, as recorded in the browser's user agent string. This issue affects Adobe Analytics reporting, because it uses the user agent to determine device information like operating system. This inaccuracy is apparently in place to prevent compatibility issues for some websites. See this [Bugzilla ticket](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=213622&utm_source=convertkit&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=User+Agent+strings%2C+new+BigQuery+features%2C+custom+Google+Tag+Manager+loader...+%E2%80%93+Simmer+Newsletter+%2311%20-%205873454) for reference. It is not clear when or if this issue will be rectified.<br>Some browsers initially recorded macOS 11 correctly, so there may be some traffic matching this value. However, because of the inaccurate reporting, filtering for operating system macOS 11 is not useful.<br>This issue is significant because starting with Safari on macOS 11, Apple updated ITP cookie expiry limitations to apply to CNAME implementations (see [WebKit blog post](https://webkit.org/blog/11338/cname-cloaking-and-bounce-tracking-defense/)).<br>Before this update, these limitations applied only to client-side cookies set via JavaScript. This inaccuracy makes it difficult to assess how much traffic is using OS 11 and is thus impacted by the ITP change. You can learn more about cookies and Adobe Analytics [here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/technotes/cookies/cookies.html#cookies). |
| End-of-life for three Analytics API services | May 19, 2021 | On August 18, 2021, the following Analytics Legacy API services reached their end-of-life date and were shut down. Any current integrations built using these services stopped working on that day.<ul><li>1.3 Analytics APIs</li><li>1.4 SOAP Analytics APIs</li><li>Legacy OAuth Authentication (OAuth and JWT)</li></ul>Adobe has provided a [Legacy API EOL FAQ](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-1.4-apis/blob/master/docs/APIEOL.md?mv=email)â€¯to help answer your questions and provide guidance on how to proceed. API integrations that employ these services can migrate to the [1.4 Analytics REST APIs](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-1.4-apis?mv=email) or the [2.0 Analytics APIs](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-2.0-apis?mv=email). Legacy OAuth accounts can migrate to an [Adobe I/O](https://console.adobe.io/home?mv=email#) Analytics integration account, which can be used to access both the 1.4 Analytics APIs and 2.0 Analytics APIs. |
| 2021 ISO region updates | May 13, 2021 | Adobe will perform 2021 ISO region updates on May 21, 2021. Expect to see minor updates following this release. |
| EOL of Full Processing Data Sources | April 12, 2021 | Adobe plans to deprecate full processing data sources on July 31, 2021. As of March 25, 2021, new imports of this type can no longer be created. Please use [Bulk Data Insertion API](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experiencecloud/analytics/docs.html#!AdobeDocs/analytics-2.0-apis/master/bdia.md) to import this type of data. |
|Sign in update to [!UICONTROL Report Builder] | April 9, 2021 | On January 14, 2021, the [!UICONTROL Report Builder] sign-in updates removed dependencies on legacy technologies and aligned the sign-in process with Experience Cloud. Experience Cloud uses your Enterprise ID (email and password). To ensure uninterrupted access to [!UICONTROL Report Builder], update the [!UICONTROL Report Builder] add-in to version 5.6.47 or later by July 22, 2021. Report Builder version 5.6.47 and later supports only the Experience Cloud sign-in and will not support single sign-on.|
| Data Feed and Data Warehouse IP Address Changes | April 6, 2021 | Starting June 17, the Data Feeds and Data Warehouse delivery system will be relocated within Adobe's data centers, and therefore can cause a change of external IP addresses visible to you. Adobe recommends that you confirm that all the IP CIDR blocks for the data center where your reports and feeds are sourced are present in firewalls for destination systems that you control. [Here is a full list of IP Address ranges to place into your firewallâ€™s allowlists](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/technotes/ip-addresses.html#data-collection-and-ftp-ip-address-blocks). |
| Notice of upcoming Analytics menu changes | March 24, 2021 | On April 22, 2021, Adobe updated the **[!UICONTROL Components]**, **[!UICONTROL Tools]**, and **[!UICONTROL Admin]** dropdown menus in order to achieve some performance gains. All of these pages are still available under the **[!UICONTROL All Components]**, **[!UICONTROL All Tools]**, and **[!UICONTROL All Admin]** links - they will be removed from the dropdown menu. Here are the menu items that will be removed from the dropdown menu and placed on their respective link page:<br><br> [!UICONTROL Components]<ul><li>[!UICONTROL Bookmarks]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Dashboards]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Targets]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Calendar Events]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Scheduled Reports]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Report Settings]</li></ul>[!UICONTROL Tools]<ul><li>[!UICONTROL Recommendations Classic]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Search & Promote]</li></ul>[!UICONTROL Admin]<ul><li>[!UICONTROL User Management]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Classification Importer]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Classification Rule Builder]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Data Sources]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Data Connectors]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Company Settings]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Logs]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Dynamic Tag Management]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Code Manager]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Exclude by IP]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Traffic Management]</li></ul> |
| Same-as-SiteCatalyst VISTA Processing ON | March 17, 2021 | On June 17, 2021, all report suites will be updated to have [!UICONTROL Same-as-SiteCatalyst VISTA Processing] set to ON. This change impacts Data Warehouse reporting by processing the data to match processing rules. For questions or clarification, reach out to Customer Care. |
| Reports & Analytics landing page options | February 19, 2021 | On March 25, 2021, options to set new Reports & Analytics dashboards or other content as your Adobe Analytics landing page were removed. If you previously set a Reports & Analytics page as your custom landing page, it continues to work until your landing page is modified in [!UICONTROL User Preferences]. |
| EOL of Adobe Data Connectors | July 13, 2020 | Adobe [!UICONTROL Data Connectors] are powered by legacy technology that is no longer viable or supported. A new standard is available in the [Adobe Exchange Partner Program](https://partners.adobe.com/exchangeprogram/experiencecloud). You can use that standard for any integration to continue to be offered and supported. The official end-of-life date is August 1, 2021.

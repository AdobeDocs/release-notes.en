Updates and new content for [!DNL Audience Manager].

+++Details

Beginning in July 2023, Adobe has discontinued the development of the [!DNL Data Integration Library (DIL)] and the [!DNL DIL] extension.

Existing customers can continue using their [!DNL DIL] implementation. However, Adobe is not developing [!DNL DIL] beyond this point. Customers are encouraged to evaluate the [Experience Platform Web SDK](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/home.html?lang=en) for their long-term data collection strategy. Customers looking to implement new data collection integrations after July 2023 should use [Experience Platform Web SDK](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/home.html?lang=en) instead.

For self-help resources, see [Audience Manager documentation and tutorials](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager.html) on Experience League.

+++Details

### [!DNL Experience Manager] roadmaps and release videos

Adobe recommends visiting the following resources to stay updated on release information:

* [Experience Manager release updates and roadmaps](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-release-information/aem-release-updates/home.html) - Learn about the Experience Manager release roadmap, previous release updates, and documentation updates.
* [Experience Manager as a Cloud Service release updates](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/events/aemcs-release-update-recordings/overview.html?lang=en) - Watch feature video overviews of current and past releases of [!DNL Experience Manager as a Cloud Service].

### Latest Release Overview video

Watch the [January 2024 Release Overview video](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/3427041?quality=12") for a summary of the features added in the 2024.01.0 (January 2024) release.

### [!DNL Experience Manager Sites] as a [!DNL Cloud Service] 

_Early Adopter Program_

You can use [Real User Monitoring (RUM) Data Service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/using-cloud-manager/content-requests.html?lang=en#real-user-monitoring-for-aem-as-a-cloud-service) to enable client-side collection for AEM as a Cloud Service.

Real User Monitoring (RUM) Data Service offers a more precise reflection of user interactions, ensuring a reliable measure of website engagement. It is a great opportunity to gain advanced insights into your page performance. While this is beneficial for customers who use either Adobe-managed CDN or non-Adobe-managed CDN. Also, for customers using a non-Adobe-managed CDN, automated traffic reporting can now be enabled for them, thus removing the need to share any traffic report with Adobe.

If you are interested in testing this new feature and sharing your feedback, send an email to [aemcs-rum-adopter@adobe.com](mailto:aemcs-rum-adopter@adobe.com), along with your domain name for the production, stage, and dev environment. Send the email from your email address associated with your Adobe ID. Adobe's product team will then enable the Real User Monitoring (RUM) Data Service for you.

### [!DNL Experience Manager Assets] as a [!DNL Cloud Service]

_New features in Assets view_

* **Create [!DNL GenAI] images with Adobe [!DNL Firefly]** &ndash; Create images based on search queries with an integration of Adobe [!DNL Firefly] text-to-image feature (requires Adobe [!DNL Firefly] license).
* **Find similar images** &ndash; Now you can easily find content by selecting an image and viewing similar images in the [!DNL Experience Manager Assets] repository.

### [!DNL Experience Manager Forms] as a [!DNL Cloud Service]

_New features_

* **[Connect an Adaptive Forms with Microsoft&reg; SharePoint List](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/integrate/services/submit-adaptive-form-to-workfront-fusion.html?lang=en)** &ndash; AEM Forms provides an out-of-the-box integration to submit forms data directly to SharePoint List, letting you use SharePoint's Lists capabilities. You can configure Microsoft&reg; SharePoint List as a datasource for a Form Data Model and use the **Submit using Form Data Model** submit action to connect an Adaptive Form with SharePoint List.

_Early Adopter Program_

* **[Submit an [!UICONTROL Adaptive Form] to Adobe [!DNL Workfront] Fusion Scenario](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/integrate/services/submit-adaptive-form-to-workfront-fusion.html?lang=en)** &ndash; Forms as a Cloud Service offers an out-of-the-box option to effortlessly connect an [!UICONTROL Adaptive Form] with Adobe [!DNL Workfront]. This connection simplifies the process of submitting an [!UICONTROL Adaptive Form] to an Adobe [!DNL Workfront] scenario, letting you trigger a [!DNL Workfront] Fusion scenario on submission of an [!UICONTROL Adaptive Form].

* **[Right to left languages support](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/adaptive-forms-authoring/authoring-adaptive-forms-core-components/create-an-adaptive-form-on-forms-cs/supporting-new-language-localization-core-components.html?lang=en)** &ndash; [!UICONTROL Adaptive Forms] built on Core Components can now be presented in a Right-to-Left (RTL) language like Arabic, Persian, and Urdu. RTL languages are spoken by more than 2 billion people globally. Using a form in RTL language lets you extend the reach of your adaptive forms to cater to these diverse audiences and select into RTL markets. In certain regions, it is also a legal mandate to provide forms in the local language. By accommodating local languages, you open doors to a broader audience and ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations.

* **[Protect your documents with DocAssurance APIs (Part of Communication APIs)](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/using-communications/aem-forms-cloud-service-communications-introduction.html?lang=en#document-assurance-doc-assurance)** &ndash; The [!DNL DocAssurance] APIs empower you to safeguard sensitive information by signing and encrypting the documents. Through encryption, the contents of a document are transformed into an unreadable format, ensuring that only authorized users can gain access. This fortified layer of protection not only shields valuable data from unauthorized eyes but also provides peace of mind. The Signature APIs let your organization protect the security and privacy of Adobe PDF documents that it distributes and receives. This service uses digital signatures and certification to ensure that only intended recipients can alter documents.

You can write to [aem-forms-early-adopter-program@adobe.com](mailto:aem-forms-early-adopter-program@adobe.com) from your official email ID to join the early adopter program and request access to the capability.

### [!DNL Experience Manager] as a [!DNL Cloud Service Foundation]

_CDN Configuration Early Adopter Program_

In addition to the recently released [Traffic Filter Rules](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/security/traffic-filter-rules-including-waf.html?lang=en), which includes the optionally licensable Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules, there is an opportunity to use the [!UICONTROL Configuration Pipeline] to declare and deploy other types of CDN configuration. Adobe wants to hear about your use cases, including the following:

* 301/302 client-side redirects
* Proxy requests at the edge to arbitrary origins
* URL transformations
* Setting or modifying request or response headers
* Custom error pages when the CDN can't reach AEM
* Authentication by username/password
* Any other useful CDN configurations

Send an email to [aemcs-cdn-config-adopter@adobe.com](mailto:aemcs-cdn-config-adopter@adobe.com) from your official email ID with your feedback.

### [!DNL Cloud Manager]

  * This feature is being rolled out in a phased manner with completion expected with the February 2024 Cloud Manager release.
  * Send an email to [Grp-CloudManager-custom-permissions@adobe.com](mailto:Grp-CloudManager-custom-permissions@adobe.com) from the email address associated with your Adobe ID, if you want to be enabled sooner.

  * For existing programs where the New Relic sub-account has not been accessed for more than 90 days, it is deactivated.
  * If you want to use the New Relic sub-account, you can opt in by way of Cloud Manager.
* The rollouts of updates to the [build environment](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/using-cloud-manager/create-application-project/build-environment-details.html?lang=en) that were [announced and begun with the October 2023 release of Cloud Manager](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/release-notes/cloud-manager/2023/2023-10-0.html?lang=en) have been completed.

  * The build container base image was updated to Ubuntu 22.04.

### [!DNL Workfront for Experience Manager] enhanced connector

The release date for the latest version 1.9.15 of Workfront for Experience Manager enhanced connector is November 17, 2023.

_Release highlights_

The latest version of the Workfront for Experience Manager enhanced connector includes the following bug fixes:

* While viewing the list of AEM folders, the dialog takes more than a minute to load.
* Authorized [!DNL Workfront] users are consistently receiving authentication failure error logs.

>[!NOTE]
>
>AEM 6.4 is now end of extended support. For more details, see Adobe's [technical support periods](https://helpx.adobe.com/support/programs/eol-matrix.html). Find the [supported versions here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/?lang=en).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Adobe recommends that you [upgrade to the latest 1.9.15 version](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/integrations/workfront-connector-install.html?lang=en) of the Workfront for Experience Manager enhanced connector.

_Known issues_

* While configuring project linked folders with AEM 6.4, [!DNL Experience Manager] does not save the values for **[!UICONTROL sub-folders]** and **[!UICONTROL Create linked folder in projects with portfolio]** fields. The value for the **[!UICONTROL sub-folders]** field updates to **[!UICONTROL undefined]**. The value for the **[!UICONTROL Create linked folder in projects with portfolio]** field updates to **[!UICONTROL Default Portfolio]** automatically after saving the configuration.
* When you use the classic Workfront experience, the **[!UICONTROL Send to]** option available in the **[!UICONTROL More]** drop-down list does not let you select the target destination within Experience Manager. The **[!UICONTROL Send to]** option works correctly using the **Document Actions** drop-down list. The **[!UICONTROL Send to]** option works correctly for **[!UICONTROL More]** drop-down list and the **[!UICONTROL Document Actions]** drop-down list available in the new Workfront experience.

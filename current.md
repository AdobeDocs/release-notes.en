  * **[!DNL Experience Manager Screens as a Cloud Service]**

    _New features_

    * [!DNL Experience Manager Screens as a Cloud Service] now supports basic playback monitoring. The player now reports various playback metrics with each ping (defaults to 30 seconds). Based on the metrics, it can detect various edge cases (stuck experience, blank screen, scheduling problem, and so on). This feature lets the team remotely monitor if a player is properly playing content. It also improves reactivity to blank screens or broken experiences in the field, and decreases the risk of showing a broken experience to the end user.
    See [Basic Playback Monitoring](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/screens-as-cloud-service/manage-player-registration/installing-screens-cloud-player.html?lang=en#playback-monitoring).
    * Thumbnail Support for videos in now supported in [!DNL Experience Manager Screens as a Cloud Service].

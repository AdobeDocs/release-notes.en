Release: **July 20 - August 31, 2023**

Adobe is updating its provisioning to provide all [!DNL Experience Cloud] customers access to foundational capabilities that aid interoperability between some [!DNL Experience Cloud] products. Users will have [!DNL Experience Platform] as a new entitlement added to their [!DNL Experience Cloud] organizations, with [Data Collection](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/reports-analytics/reporting-interface/overview-data-collection.html) as an included service. [!DNL Experience Platform] [!UICONTROL Data Collection] includes tags for simplified universal tag management and offers a trusted, robust, and complete streaming data infrastructure. This update simplifies your experience data collection and streamlines experience delivery. 

With this update, administrators may see changes or additions to the Admin Console:

* The Adobe [!DNL Experience Platform] product card in the Admin Console will include: [Places](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/places/using/home.html), [Assurance](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/implement-mobile-sdk/app-implementation/assurance.html), [Identity Namespace](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/identity/home.html), [Sandboxes](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/sandbox/home.html), [Experience Data Model](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/xdm/home.html), [Schemas](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/xdm/schema/composition.html), [Datastreams](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/datastreams/overview.html), and [Experience Cloud ID](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/id-service/using/intro/overview.html).

  * For organizations who are not currently using [!DNL Experience Platform], you will now see the [!DNL Experience Platform] product in the [!UICONTROL Admin Console], including the capabilities listed above.

  * For organizations currently using [!DNL Experience Platform], [!UICONTROL Places] will be consolidated into the [!DNL Experience Platform] card.

* Adobe [!DNL Experience Platform] [Data Collection](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/reports-analytics/reporting-interface/overview-data-collection.html) (formerly [!DNL Launch]) and [Privacy](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/privacy/home.html) will continue to appear as their own product cards, separate from the other [!DNL Experience Platform] capabilities

_Known issues_

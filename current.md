* The [Content Fragment Console](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/sites/administering/content-fragments/content-fragments-console.html) now lets users efficiently manage translated content fragments.

_New feature available in prerelease channel_

In addition, orientation information is populated in `cq:tags`, which enables better search results using the [!UICONTROL Orientation] filter.
* [!DNL Experience Manager Assets] now [supports SAS Token](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/manage/add-assets.html?lang=en#asset-bulk-ingestor) in addition to the Access Key for authentication while connecting to Azure Blob Storage data source for ingesting assets using the [!UICONTROL Bulk Import] tool.

The wizard has a quick tab navigation to easily select pre-configured template, styling, fields, and submission options to create an adaptive form.

  * Select or deselect fields: The wizard allows you to create an [!UICONTROL Adaptive Form] based on JSON and Form Data Model schemas. You can now select subset of fields within a schema to include in an [!UICONTROL Adaptive Form]. The selected fields are converted to corresponding [!UICONTROL Adaptive Form] data capture components to quickly create the desired adaptive forms.
  * Use [!UICONTROL Static Templates]: Customers with existing investments in legacy-static templates can continue their journey of cloud adoption by using static templates in the wizard to author adaptive forms. This provides additional time to customers to migrate old static templates to modern editable templates.
* [Remove hidden fields from a Document of Record (DoR) while server-side processing](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/create-an-adaptive-form/generate-document-of-record-for-non-xfa-based-adaptive-forms.html?lang=en): You can generate the document of record PDF for end users containing only those fields which were visible to them during data capture experience. Upon form submission, the server validates which fields were hidden to the end user based on submitted data and excludes from document of record for consistency.

_New features available in prerelease channel_

* **[!UICONTROL Adaptive Forms] template editor** - Template editor lets you pre-define the basic structure and appearance of [!UICONTROL Adaptive Forms] of an organization. This release brings following improvements to the template editor:

The option is also added to [!UICONTROL Adaptive Forms] editor to let users select or change Form Data Model for existing forms.
  * **[Document of Record in template editor](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/create-an-adaptive-form/generate-document-of-record-for-non-xfa-based-adaptive-forms.html?lang=en#document-of-record-support-in-adaptive-form-editor-dor-support-in-adaptiveform)** - You can now standardize Document of Record generation for all forms created using a template. This ability helps enhance compliance and standardization for organization requirements.
* **[Launch the Adaptive Form wizard from a AEM Sites Page](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/integrate/embed-adaptive-form-aem-sites.html?lang=en)** - AEM Sites page has extended support for [!UICONTROL Adaptive Forms].

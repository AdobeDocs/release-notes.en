<!-- _New feature in prerelease channel_ -->

### [!DNL Experience Manager Assets] as a [!DNL Cloud Service]

_New features in Assets view_

* **Bulk import assets from data sources** &ndash; Administrators can now [import many assets](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/assets-view/bulk-import-assets-view.html?lang=en) from a data source to AEM Assets. The administrators do not need to upload individual assets or folders to AEM Assets anymore. The supported data sources for bulk import include Azure, AWS, Google Cloud, and Dropbox.
* **Image editing tools powered by Adobe Express** &ndash; Easy and intuitive [image editing tools powered by Adobe Express](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/assets-view/edit-images-assets-view.html?lang=en) available directly within AEM Assets to increase content reuse and accelerate content velocity.
* **Flexibility while pinning items for My Workspace Quick Access** &ndash; The ability to select and pin items for your organization or for a list of groups so that they display in the [Quick Access section of My Workspace](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/assets-view/my-workspace-assets-view.html?lang=en).

_New features in Admin view_

* Administrators can now [configure the batch size of assets](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/manage/search-assets.html?lang=en#configure-asset-batch-size) that display when you perform a search. The asset search results display in multiples of the configured batch size number when you further scroll down to load the results. You can select from the available batch sizes of 200, 500, and 1000 assets. Setting a lower batch size number results in faster search response times.
* Experience Manager Assets now includes a new version 9 of the `damAssetLucene` index. `damAssetLucene-9` changes the behavior of Oak Query facet counting to [no longer evaluate access control on the facet counts](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/manage/search-assets.html?lang=en) returned by the underlying search index, which results in the faster search response times.

_New features in prerelease channel_

* **Dynamic Media** &ndash; [Support for multi-subtitles and multi-audio tracks in videos](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/dynamicmedia/video.html?lang=en#about-msma). In [!DNL Dynamic Media], you can now easily add multiple subtitles and multiple audio tracks to a primary video. This capability means that your videos are accessible across a global audience. You can customize a single, published primary video to a global audience in multiple languages and adhere with accessibility guidelines for different geographical regions. Authors can also manage the subtitles and audio tracks from a single tab in the user interface.
* **Assets** &ndash; Ability to select ZIP archives that are managed in Experience Manager and [extracting the files directly into Experience Manager](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/manage/manage-digital-assets.html?lang=en#extract-zip-archives) without downloading them.

### [!DNL Experience Manager Forms] as a [!DNL Cloud Service]

_New features_

* **[Google reCAPTCHA enterprise support](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/adaptive-forms-authoring/authoring-adaptive-forms-foundation-components/add-components-to-an-adaptive-form/captcha-adaptive-forms.html?lang=en)** &ndash; Use Google reCAPTCHA Enterprise in an Adaptive Form to provide enhanced protection against fraudulent activity and spam, providing a safer user experience. With advanced risk analysis and seamless integration, genuine users can easily submit forms while bots are effectively blocked.

_New features in prerelease channel_

* **Adobe Analytics with Experience Cloud Setup Automation for Forms** &ndash; You can now enable Adobe Analytics with Experience Cloud Setup Automation with a flip of a couple of buttons. It enables you to connect [!DNL AEM Forms as a Cloud Service] with Experience Platform tags and Adobe Analytics to capture and track performance metrics for your published forms.
* **Adobe Analytics report template for Adaptive Forms** &ndash; [!DNL Forms as a Cloud Service] now provides an Adobe Analytics report out-of-the-box. It helps you easily understand the performance of your forms. The form-level metrics provide you with an insight into how the form is performing on multiple key performance indicators (KPIs) like renditions, visitors, submissions, and average fill time. By tracking user behavior and feedback, you can identify areas of the form that are causing confusion and guide improvements to the form's design and functionality.
* [[!UICONTROL Form Fragments] in [!UICONTROL Adaptive Forms] based on Core Components](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/adaptive-forms-authoring/authoring-adaptive-forms-core-components/create-an-adaptive-form-on-forms-cs/adaptive-form-fragments-core-components.html?lang=en) &ndash; Say goodbye to duplication, optimize your digital inventory, and improve collaboration as you elevate your form-building experience with [!UICONTROL Form Fragments]. These reusable components seamlessly integrate into multiple forms, streamlining the creation of consistent and professional-looking forms. [!UICONTROL Form Fragments] ensure reusability, standardization, and brand consistency through _change once and reflect everywhere_ functionality. Experience greater maintainability and efficiency as updates made in one place are automatically propagated across all forms that use these fragments.
* [Enhanced Acrobat Sign Workflow step](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/create-form-centric-workflows/aem-forms-workflow-step-reference.html?lang=en#sign-document-step-sign-document-step) &ndash; The [!DNL Acrobat Sign] Workflow step is enhanced to include the following:

  * **Government ID-Based Authentication for Acrobat Sign** &ndash; Acrobat Sign Government ID-Based Authentication offers an additional layer of verification by enabling users to authenticate their identity using government-issued IDs (driver's license, national ID, passport). By using trusted identification documents, this enhancement adds an extra level of confidence to the signing process, making it ideal for scenarios that require heightened security, compliance, and user validation.
  * **Audit Trail for Acrobat Sign Documents** &ndash; Use the Audit Trail feature for detailed insights into the lifecycle of your Acrobat Sign documents. With the Audit Trail, you can now maintain a comprehensive record of all actions and interactions related to your documents. This record includes details such as who viewed, edited, or signed the document, along with timestamps for each event. This record enhancement is crucial for maintaining compliance, resolving disputes, and ensuring the integrity of your digital agreements.
  * **New roles for Agreement recipients beyond just the Signer** &ndash; Adobe Acrobat Sign now lets you expand the roles for Agreement recipients beyond just the Signer to better match their workflow requirements. When enabled, each recipient in an Agreement has their role individually configurable, with Signer being the default.

* [Protect your documents with Document Assurance APIs (Part of Communication APIs)](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/using-communications/aem-forms-cloud-service-communications-introduction.html?lang=en#document-assurance-doc-assurance) &ndash; The Document Assurance APIs empowers you to safeguard sensitive information by signing and encrypting the documents. Through encryption, the contents of a document are transformed into an unreadable format, ensuring that only authorized users can gain access. This fortified layer of protection not only shields valuable data from unauthorized eyes but also provides peace of mind. The Signature APIs let your organization protect the security and privacy of Adobe PDF documents that it distributes and receives. This service uses digital signatures and certification to ensure that only intended recipients can alter documents.
* **Page Count Support in Communication APIs** &ndash; Now, along with retrieving your document through the Communication APIs, you can also receive the valuable information about the number of pages contained within the document.
* [Error handling with custom error handlers in rule editor](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/adaptive-forms-authoring/authoring-adaptive-forms-core-components/create-an-adaptive-form-on-forms-cs/add-custom-error-handler-adaptive-forms-core-components.html?lang=en) &ndash; You can now invoke a custom function in response to an error returned by an external service and provide a tailored response to end users. For example, you can invoke a custom workflow in the backend for specific error codes or inform the customer that the service is down.

Use [Headless Adaptive Forms](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-headless-adaptive-forms/using/overview.html?lang=en) to let developers create, publish, and manage interactive forms that can be accessed and interacted with through APIs, rather than through a traditional graphical user interface.

Experience Audit is included as a step in the Cloud Manager production pipeline.

  The dashboard uses Google Lighthouse, an open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of your web apps. You can run it against any web page that is public, or requires authentication. It has audits for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, SEO, and more.

  Interested in test-driving the new dashboard? Send an email to [aem-lighthouse-pilot@adobe.com](mailto:aem-lighthouse-pilot@adobe.com) from your email associated with your Adobe ID and Adobe can get you started.

**Bug fixes**

* It is no longer possible under certain rare circumstances to start two executions from the same pipeline leading to a "stuck" state.
* When a certificate expires, domain names and IP allowlists associated with the certificate are no longer removed from the CDN.
  * In such cases, the site remains reachable.

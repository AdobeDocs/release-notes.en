Learn about the latest features and updates in [!DNL Adobe System Status].

+++Details

[!DNL Adobe System Status] provides detailed information, status updates, and email notifications about Adobe products and services outages, disruptions, and maintenance events. Check it out at [status.adobe.com](https://status.adobe.com/).

**What's new**

* [!DNL Status] has added API support that allows you to directly call Adobe's servers to query and view events like on the [status.adobe.com](https://status.adobe.com/) UI. You can use these APIs to integrate into your monitoring system or dashboards to view real-time events from Adobe Status that can be filtered based on Product, Product Offering, Region, Environment (where available), Locale, and Event type.

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | -------|
|Adobe Status APIs|<ul><li>Adobe Status APIs provide detailed information and real-time updates about Adobe cloud products and services outage, disruption, and maintenance events.</li><li>The APIs need to be set up in [Adobe Developer Console](https://developer.adobe.com/console) before they can be used. Your organization must have entitlements for at least one Adobe product to access Adobe APIs. A developer console account is required with the correct permissions.</li><li>Please check out the documentation [here](https://developer.adobe.com/adobe-status/) and follow the guides for setup.</li><li>Once the setup is done, you can use the [API reference document](https://developer.adobe.com/adobe-status/api/) to view the available APIs and the signatures to call them.</li></ul>|

{style="table-layout:auto"}

### New features in [!DNL Advertising Search] {#advertising-search}

Last updated: **March 2, 2023**

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [!UICONTROL Campaigns] | (Google Ads accounts; open beta feature; February 23 release) Read-only sync support for [!DNL Google Ads] discovery campaigns is in beta mode for all advertisers.  Discovery campaigns have [!UICONTROL Campaign Type] "[!UICONTROL Discovery]," [!UICONTROL Ad Group Type] "[!UICONTROL Discovery]," and [!UICONTROL Creative Type] "[!UICONTROL Discovery Ad]" (for single-image ads) or "[!UICONTROL Discovery Carousel Ad]" (for multi-image carousel ads). You can include discovery campaigns in standard and hybrid portfolios.<br><br>Ad-level data for your discovery campaigns is available in reports. For advertisers with an Adobe Analytics integration, ad-level data is available in [!DNL Analytics]. Similarly, [!DNL Analytics] data is available in [!DNL Search]; the data is sent using the upgraded `s_kwcid` tracking parameter, regardless of the `s_kwcid` format you normally use for the account. If you normally use the older version of the `s_kwcid`, then your click/cost data and revenue data are tracked using different `s_kwcids`, but both sets of data are fully classified and aggregated under the same campaign and account. |
|  | ([!DNL Google Ads] accounts; February 11 release) Support for the "[!UICONTROL Target Impression Share]" bid strategy is now available for campaigns on the search network only. For this bid strategy, [!DNL Google Ads] (not [!DNL Search]) optimizes bids in order to achieve a target impression share and ad position. You can optionally enter a [!UICONTROL Target Impression Share] as a percent, the [!UICONTROL Target Ad Position], and a [!UICONTROL Max CPC] (cost per click). This option isn't yet supported in hybrid portfolios. |
| [!UICONTROL Bulksheets] | ([!DNL Microsoft] campaigns; February 11 release) Bulksheets now include "[!UICONTROL Call to Action]" and "[!UICONTROL Call to Action Language]" columns for multimedia ads (in responsive ad format), which use the "[!UICONTROL Creative (except RSA)]" row. |
| Google Manager Accounts | (February 23 release) A new [!UICONTROL Admin] > [!UICONTROL Manager Accounts] feature allows you to provide authentication for [!DNL Google Ads] manager accounts to which [!DNL Search] will upload cross-account conversions. Use this feature if you want to a) upload [!DNL Adobe]-tracked, cross-account conversion metrics to a [!DNL Google Ads] manager account or b) upload portfolio objectives that include cross-account conversions to [!DNL Google Ads] for hybrid optimization.<br><br>Once you add credentials for a manager account, the optional "[!UICONTROL Manager Account for Cross-Account Conversions]" column in the [!UICONTROL Campaigns] > [!UICONTROL Accounts] view indicates the manager account ID for each child account, and the column shows an error when the manager account isn't authenticated. |

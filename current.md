### Experience Manager [!DNL Sites] as a [!DNL Cloud Service]

_New features in AEM Sites_

The [!UICONTROL Email] component allows the creation of content in AEM that is then delivered as emails via [!DNL Campaign Classic]. The [!UICONTROL Core Email Component]:

* Is based on the [Core WCM Component](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-wcm-components) which supports Editable Templates and the Style System.

* Provides ten email-optimized production-ready components (Page, Container, Title, Text, Image, Button, Teaser, Experience Fragment, Content Fragment, Segmentation).

* Provides advanced personalization and segmentation, thanks to the [insertion of Campaign variables](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-email-components/wiki/RTE-Personalization) on most dialog fields, and to the flexible [Segmentation component](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-email-components/wiki/(Technical-Documentation)).

* Provides optimal email-friendly HTML output, thanks to the [CSS styles inliner](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-email-components/wiki/HTML-Inliner:-Technical-documentation), the [HTML attribute inliner](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-email-components/wiki/HTML-Inliner:-Technical-documentation), and the [HTML sanitizer](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-email-components/wiki/HTML-sanitizing:-Technical-documentation).

* Allows the creation of the emails anywhere.

_New features available in [!DNL Sites] prerelease channel_

* The [Content Fragment Console](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/sites/administering/content-fragments/content-fragments-console.html?lang=en) provides users with an option to display the total number of language copies associated with a content fragment. A one-click access has been provided to view all the language copies as well. Users are also able to filter the table view by the locale of their interest.

### Experience Manager [!DNL Assets] as a [!DNL Cloud Service]

_New features in [!DNL Assets]_

* You can now configure Adobe Experience Manager Assets to [restrict the type of assets that users can upload based on the MIME type](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/admin/configure-asset-upload-restrictions.html?lang=en).

### Experience Manager [!DNL Forms] as a [!DNL Cloud Service]

_New features_

[Adaptive Forms wizard](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/create-an-adaptive-form/create-an-adaptive-form-on-forms-cs/creating-adaptive-form.html?lang=en): [!DNL AEM Forms] provides business user friendly wizard to quickly author [!UICONTROL Adaptive Forms]. The wizard has a quick tab navigation to easily select pre-configured template, styling, fields, and submission options to create an adaptive form. This release brings following improvements to the wizard:

* **Select or deselect fields:** The wizard allows you to create an Adaptive Form based on JSON and Form Data Model schemas. You can now select subset of fields within a schema to include in an Adaptive Form. The selected fields are converted to corresponding Adaptive Form data capture components to quickly create the desired adaptive forms.

* **Use Static Templates:** Customers with existing investments in legacy static templates can continue their journey of cloud adoption by using static templates in wizard to author adaptive forms. This provides additional time to customers to migrate old static templates to modern editable templates.

* [Remove hidden fields from a Document of Record (DoR) while server-side processing](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/create-an-adaptive-form/generate-document-of-record-for-non-xfa-based-adaptive-forms.html?lang=en): You can generate the document of record PDF for end users containing only those fields which were visible to them during data capture experience. Upon form submission, the server validates which fields were hidden to the end user based on submitted data and excludes from document of record for consistency.

### Cloud Manager

* [!DNL AEM Guides] can now be configured in a self-service manner on Sandbox programs.

* Customers without any [!DNL Cloud Manager] role cannot access program details. They can however, navigate to Author end points from [!DNL Cloud Manager] landing pages.

* Customers can set up **Incident and Proactive notification** groups to hear from Adobe about incidents or recommendations related to their AEMaaCS application. See [User Group for Notifications](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/onboarding/journey/user-groups.html?lang=en) for more details.

* **[!UICONTROL Add Program Affordance]** in the UI consistently provides tool tips when it is disabled due to permission or entitlement related reasons.

### [!DNL Workfront] for Experience Manager enhanced connector

The latest version (1.9.3) of [!DNL Workfront] for Experience Manager enhanced connector was made available on **September 16, 2022**. See [Release Notes](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/release-notes/workfront/release-notes-enhanced-connector-workfront.html?lang=en) for more information.

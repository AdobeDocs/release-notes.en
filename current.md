### New features across [!DNL Advertising Cloud] {#adcloud-all}

Last updated: **October 27, 2021**

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Analytics for Advertising Cloud | If your organization wants to switch from using the legacy Adobe Analytics `visitorAPI.js` library to the Adobe Experience Platform library (`alloy.js`) for data collection, you must make changes to enable ID stitching. See [Using the [!DNL Last Event Service] JavaScript Library with Adobe Experience Platform [!DNL Web SDK]](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/advertising-cloud/integrations/analytics/planning/web-sdk.html). |

### New features in [!DNL Advertising Cloud DSP] {#adcloud-dsp}

Last updated: **October 27, 2021**

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Custom Reports | You can now create and manage [!DNL Amazon S3] and different types of FTP delivery locations, called *[!DNL report destinations]*, for your custom reports. Once you configure report destinations, you can set up each of your new custom reports to be delivered to one or more locations of a single destination type, or to email recipients. Updates to your [!DNL Amazon S3] and FTP credentials won't interrupt report delivery.<br><br>Your existing reports are still sent to the specified email recipients. To configure delivery to a different report destination, create a report with the new destination. |
| [!UICONTROL Packages], [!UICONTROL Placements], and [!UICONTROL Ads] views| When you view data for a single day, the trend charts now include hourly data. Hold the cursor over any point to see the data for that hour. |
| [!UICONTROL Placements] | The placement [!UICONTROL Inspector] now includes an [!UICONTROL Inventory] tab, which shows all deals and their associated metrics for the placement. Use the information to make quick adjustments or troubleshoot issues without generating a custom report. |
| [!UICONTROL Ads] | (Users with permission to include Clearcastclock numbers in their ads) DSP no longer shows an error if you use a clock number that's attached to another ad. **Note:**  The best practice is to use a unique clock number for each video ad. Otherwise, the publisher does not approve all the ads. |
| [!UICONTROL Deal IDs] | The [!UICONTROL Deal ID] settings and other places in the user interface reflect new branding for [!DNL Magnite] SSP:<br><ul><li>The SSP [!DNL Tremor] ([!DNL Telaria]) is now [!DNL Magnite CTV].</li><li>In the coming weeks, [!DNL Rubicon] will change to [!DNL Magnite DV+], where [!DNL DV+] stands for display, video, and other formats such as audio.</li></ul> |
| [!DNL Freewheel] programmatically guaranteed deals | You can now find the status of ads for [!DNL Freewheel] programmatically guaranteed deals from the [!UICONTROL Ads] view. Previously, you could check the status only from the [!UICONTROL Deals] view. |

### New features in [!DNL Advertising Cloud Search] {#adcloud-search}

Last updated: **March 14, 2022** for March 12 release

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [!UICONTROL Portfolios] | By default, hybrid optimization is available at the campaign level. You can now optionally enable hybrid optimization at the ad group level, for which the optimization capability sets [!DNL Google] CPA or ROAS targets at the ad group level for more precise control over performance.<br>With any portfolio, you must allow for a learning period before you launch the portfolio to ensure that it has sufficient model coverage. Similarly, if you change a hybrid portfolio from campaign-level to ad group-level optimization, then set the portfolio to the active state for about two weeks. This ensures that the optimization capability has time to learn about the included ad groups and generate targets.<br>To support ad group-level optimization, custom simulations can now include results by ad group. Run a custom simulation with ad group-level results before you launch a hybrid portfolio with ad group-level optimization. |
| [!UICONTROL Portfolios] <br> [!UICONTROL Campaigns] | (Beta feature, [!DNL Microsoft® Advertising] campaigns) - You can now configure search campaigns to use the [!UICONTROL Maximize Conversions] bidding strategy, and optionally set a maximum cost per click.<br>If you are already participating in the hybrid optimization beta for other auto-bidding strategies, you automatically have access to the [!UICONTROL Maximize Conversions] strategy, and you can include campaigns with the [!UICONTROL Maximize Conversions] strategy in hybrid portfolios. To use this strategy in a hybrid portfolio, you must enable uploading of Advertising Cloud Search objectives to [!DNL Microsoft® Ads]. If you aren't already participating in the beta and want to join, contact your [!DNL Adobe] account manager. |
| Campaign [!UICONTROL Audiences]<br><br>Campaign [!UICONTROL Bulksheets] | ([!DNL Microsoft® Advertising] campaigns) - You can now use any of your [!DNL Microsoft® Advertising] audiences except for in-market audiences as either campaign-level targets or [!UICONTROL adgroup]-level targets. Previously, you could use them only as [!UICONTROL adgroup]-level targets. |
| Campaign [!UICONTROL Audiences] | (Beta feature, [!DNL Microsoft® Advertising] accounts that are eligible for [!UICONTROL Customer Match]) You can now create and manage customer match audiences by uploading CSV files with email addresses. The data must be hashed using the SHA-256 algorithm. |

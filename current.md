Through encryption, the contents of a document are transformed into an unreadable format, ensuring that only authorized users can gain access. This fortified layer of protection not only shields valuable data from unauthorized eyes but also provides peace of mind. The Signature APIs let your organization protect the security and privacy of Adobe PDF documents that it distributes and receives. This service uses digital signatures and certification to ensure that only intended recipients can alter documents.
* **Page Count Support in Communication APIs** &ndash; Now, along with retrieving your document through the Communication APIs, you can also receive the valuable information about the number of pages contained within the document.
* [Error handling with custom error handlers in rule editor](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/adaptive-forms-authoring/authoring-adaptive-forms-core-components/create-an-adaptive-form-on-forms-cs/add-custom-error-handler-adaptive-forms-core-components.html?lang=en) &ndash; You can now invoke a custom function in response to an error returned by an external service and provide a tailored response to end users.

### [!DNL Workfront for Experience Manager] enhanced connector

The release date for the latest version 1.9.12 of Workfront for Experience Manager enhanced connector is August 9, 2023.

_Release highlights_

* The latest version of the Workfront for Experience Manager enhanced connector includes the following updates:

  * Unable to create linked folders in Experience Manager, as there is no user account associated with the linked folder.
  * Race conditions during metadata updates for an asset in Experience Manager.

>[!NOTE]
>
>AEM 6.4 is now end of extended support. For more details, see Adobe's [technical support periods](https://helpx.adobe.com/support/programs/eol-matrix.html). Find the [supported versions here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/?lang=en).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Adobe recommends that you [upgrade to the latest 1.9.12 version](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/integrations/workfront-connector-install.html?lang=en) of the Workfront for Experience Manager enhanced connector.

_Known issues_

* While configuring project linked folders with AEM 6.4, [!DNL Experience Manager] does not save the values for **sub-folders** and **Create linked folder in projects with portfolio** fields. The value for the **sub-folders** field updates to **undefined**. The value for the **Create linked folder in projects with portfolio** field updates to **Default Portfolio** automatically after saving the configuration.
* When you use the classic Workfront experience, the **Send to** option available in the **More** drop-down list does not let you select the target destination within Experience Manager. The **Send to** option works correctly using the **Document Actions** drop-down list. The **Send to** option works correctly for **More** drop-down list and the **Document Actions** drop-down list available in the new Workfront experience.

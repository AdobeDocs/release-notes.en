  * **New roles for Agreement recipients beyond just the Signer** &ndash; Adobe Acrobat Sign now lets you expand the roles for Agreement recipients beyond just the Signer to better match their workflow requirements.

* **[Error handling with custom error handlers in rule editor](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/adaptive-forms-authoring/authoring-adaptive-forms-core-components/create-an-adaptive-form-on-forms-cs/add-custom-error-handler-adaptive-forms-core-components.html?lang=en)** &ndash; You can now invoke a custom function in response to an error returned by an external service and provide a tailored response to end users.

_Early adopter program_

* **[Protect your documents with DocAssurance APIs (Part of Communication APIs)](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/using-communications/aem-forms-cloud-service-communications-introduction.html?lang=en#document-assurance-doc-assurance)** &ndash; The DocAssurance APIs empower you to safeguard sensitive information by signing and encrypting the documents. Through encryption, the contents of a document are transformed into an unreadable format, ensuring that only authorized users can gain access. This fortified layer of protection not only shields valuable data from unauthorized eyes but also provides peace of mind. The Signature APIs let your organization protect the security and privacy of Adobe PDF documents that it distributes and receives. This service uses digital signatures and certification to ensure that only intended recipients can alter documents.

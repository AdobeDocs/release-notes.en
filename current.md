### Important notices for [!DNL Analytics] administrators {#aa-notices}

| Notice | Date Added or Updated  | Description |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
|Required [!UICONTROL Report Builder] update |January 8, 2021 |By April 30, 2021, all [!UICONTROL Report Builder] users must update the [!UICONTROL Report Builder] add-in to version 5.6.47 or later. This version includes a critical update to the sign-in process. Users who do not update to version 5.6.47 or later will not be able to sign-in after April 30, 2021. [!UICONTROL Report Builder] version 5.6.47 and later supports Experience Cloud login only and does not support legacy logins such as SiteCatalyst Single Sign-on or the standard sign-in. For more information, see [Report Builder Sign-In](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/report-builder/report-builder-setup/login.html?lang=en#section_6D54B8ADAE7F416BB83F5082B3771CFA). |
| End-of-life for three Analytics API services | January 6, 2021 | On April 30, 2021, the following Analytics Legacy API services are slated to reach their end-of-life date and will be shut down. Any current integrations built using these services will stop working on that day.<ul><li>1.3 Analytics APIs</li><li>1.4 SOAP Analytics APIs</li><li>Legacy OAuth Authentication (OAuth and JWT)</li></ul>We have provided a [Legacy API EOL FAQ](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-1.4-apis/blob/master/docs/APIEOL.md?mv=email) to help answer your questions and provide guidance on how to proceed. API integrations that employ these services can migrate to the [1.4 Analytics REST APIs](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-1.4-apis?mv=email) and/or the [2.0 Analytics APIs](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-2.0-apis?mv=email). Legacy OAuth accounts can migrate to an [Adobe IO](https://console.adobe.io/home?mv=email#) Analytics integration account, which can be used to access both the 1.4 Analytics APIs and 2.0 Analytics APIs. |
| Adding HSTS header to all incoming HTTPS requests | Sept. 29, 2020 | On Sept. 29, 2020, we started adding the HSTS header to all incoming requests that use HTTPS. This instructs the browser/client to make all future requests in HTTPS, which is a considered a security best practice. At this point, we will not enforce this for incoming requests using HTTP. |
| Change to [!UICONTROL Experience Cloud ID Service] cookie setting | Sept. 22, 2020 | An update to the privacy settings for Chrome version 80 impacted the ability of Adobe Analytics to track some users viewing Google AMP pages. Specifically, it prevents cross-domain tracking of users viewing Google-hosted AMP pages. This could result in inflated counts of unique visitors. This fix allows users to address this problem by changing the settings for their ECID cookies.<br>Currently, Analytics sets [!UICONTROL Experience Cloud ID Service] (ECID) cookies with the setting `SameSite = Lax` which, prior to version 80 of Chrome, allowed cross-domain tracking. This is no longer the case. This change allows users to update the SameSite setting for ECID cookies to `None`.<br>Note that this allows the Analytics cookie to be shared in more situations, but Analytics cookies do not contain sensitive information. In addition, when choosing this setting, cookies must be set to `Secure` so that data can be passed only via HTTPS connections. If you would like to make this change, please have a supported user open a ticket with Customer Care. |
| Migration from `omniture.com` to `adobe.com` domain | Aug. 21, 2020 | On August 13, 2020, Adobe Analytics migrated its frontend architecture from `omniture.com|http://omniture.com/` to the `adobe.com|http://adobe.com/` domain. This change should mitigate third-party cookie issues that arose after the initial May 28, 2020 unified product domain change. As a result of this update, the browser may prompt users to trust the new an `.adobe.com|http://an.adobe.com/` or `experience.adobe.com|http://experience.adobe.com/` domain. |
| Update on Ad Hoc Analysis Java 8 compatibility | Aug. 21, 2020 | Ad Hoc Analysis is not currently compatible with Java 8 versions 1.8.0_261+. To ensure that your access to this tool is not disrupted before the [end-of-life date](https://spark.adobe.com/page/S9Bhp66VJ2fEn/) is reached, we recommend that you maintain a Java 8 version prior to 1.8.0_261. |
| EOL of Adobe Data Connectors | July 13, 2020 | Adobe [!UICONTROL Data Connectors] are powered by legacy technology that is no longer viable or supported. We have a new standard in the [Adobe Exchange Partner Program](https://partners.adobe.com/exchangeprogram/experiencecloud) that should be adopted for any integrations that wish to continue to be offered and supported. The official end-of-life date is still to be determined, but we anticipate it to be in the next 12-18 months (mid 2021 to end of 2021). [Learn more...](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/import/dataconnectors/data-connectors-eol.html) |
| EOL of Ad Hoc Analysis | Aug. 6, 2018 | Adobe announced the intention to end-of-life Ad Hoc Analysis on March 1, 2021. For more information, visit [Discover Workspace](https://spark.adobe.com/page/S9Bhp66VJ2fEn/). |

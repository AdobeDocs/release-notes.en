* Images can now be dynamically optimized for web-delivery in headless scenarios using AEM GraphQL. [Query variables](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/getting-started-with-aem-headless/how-to/images.html?lang=en#query-variables) can be defined in GraphQL queries to allow decoupled client applications request accordingly optimized images from AEM.

### [!DNL Experience Manager Assets] as a [!DNL Cloud Service]

_New features_

**New [!UICONTROL Assets] view**

The new [Assets view](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/assets-view/assets-view-introduction.html?lang=en) provides simplified user interface, which makes it easy to manage, discover, and distribute your digital assets. The experience is targeted to creatives, read-only asset consumers, and lighter-weight DAM users.

**Search experience enhancements**

[!DNL Experience Manager Assets] now empowers you to do more from the search results user interface. You can:

* [Perform search within the current repository location](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/manage/search-assets.html) by default instead of searching for the keyword in the entire repository.

* [Navigate to the folder location](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/manage/search-assets.html?#aftersearch) for assets that display in the search results.

**Thumbnail previews for 3D assets**

[!DNL Experience Manager Assets] now generates [thumbnail previews for common 3D file formats](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/file-format-support.html), including gLB, USDz, FBX, 3DS, OBJ, and SBSAR. When these files are uploaded, thumbnails are automatically generated by default.

**Link share configuration**

A new improved user experience for [creating link shares](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/manage/share-assets.html) along with a brand new set of configurations that let administrators customize the default behavior of this capability for your users.

**Dynamic Media: Updated Smart Crop-related fields in Image profile**

The user interface for some Smart Crop-related fields in an Image Profile are now updated to reflect the current guidelines for defining a Smart Crop. See [Crop options](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/dynamicmedia/image-profiles.html?#crop-options).

_New features in Assets view_

**Hierarchical tagging of assets for faster search experience**

Flat lists of controlled vocabularies become unmanageable over time. Assets view now supports [hierarchical tagging structure](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/assets-view/tagging-management-assets-view.html), which facilitates applying relevant metadata, categorizing assets, supporting search, reusing tags, improving discoverability, and so on.

**Pin files, folders, and collections for quick access**

You can now [pin files, folders, and collections for faster access](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/assets-view/my-workspace-assets-view.html) to these items when you need them later. The pinned items display in the Quick access section of My Workspace. You can access them using My Workspace instead of navigating to the location where they are saved within the repository.

**Filter assets in the Trash folder**

Assets view now enables you to [filter assets available in the Trash folder](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/assets-view/navigate-assets-view.html). You can apply standard or custom filters to search appropriate assets within the Trash folder to either restore or permanently delete them.

**Thumbnail previews for 3D assets**

Assets view now generates thumbnail previews for common 3D file formats including gLB, USDz, FBX, 3DS, OBJ, and SBSAR. When these files are uploaded to Assets view, thumbnails are automatically generated by the system, by default.

**View top searched terms**

Assets view now supports viewing [top searched terms within your deployment](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/assets-view/my-workspace-assets-view.html) using the **[!UICONTROL Insights]** section of **[!UICONTROL My Workspace]**. You can also navigate to detailed Insights to view top searches during the last 30 days or 12 months.

**Metadata form enhancements**

Assets view now enables you to [add multi-value text and drop-down list property components](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/assets-view/metadata-assets-view.html?#property-components) to the metadata forms.

### [!DNL Experience Manager Forms] as a [!DNL Cloud Service]

_New features available in Forms_

* [Adaptive Forms within AEM Page Editor and Experience Fragment](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/adaptive-forms-authoring/create-or-add-an-adaptive-form-to-aem-sites-page.html): You can use AEM [!UICONTROL Page Editor] and [!UICONTROL Experience Fragments] to quickly create and add multiple forms to your AEM Sites pages. This capability allows content authors to create seamless data capture experiences within [!DNL Sites] pages using the power of [!UICONTROL Adaptive Forms] components including dynamic behavior, validations, data integration, generate document of record and business process automation.

* [Use Acrobat Sign Solutions for Government (HIPPA Complaint) with AEM Forms](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/integrate/services/adobe-sign-integration-adaptive-forms.html): [!DNL AEM Forms] now integrates with [!DNL Acrobat Sign Solutions] for Government. This integration provides an advanced level of compliance and security for e-Signatures with Adaptive Form submissions for government associated accounts (Government departments and agencies).

Integration with Adobe Acrobat Sign Solutions for Government enables Adobe's partners and government customers to use electronic signatures in [!UICONTROL Adaptive Forms] for some of the most mission-critical and sensitive lines of business. This additional layer of security ensures that all e-signatures are fully compliant with FedRAMP Moderate compliance, providing Adobe's government customers with peace of mind.

* [Enhanced error handling with custom error handlers in rule editor](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/adaptive-forms-authoring/authoring-adaptive-forms-foundation-components/add-rules-and-use-expressions-in-an-adaptive-form/add-custom-error-handler-adaptive-forms.html): You can now invoke a custom function (using Client Library) in response to an error returned by an external service and provide a tailored response to end users. Or, you can take specific actions for errors returned by a service. For example, you can invoke a custom workflow in the backend for specific error codes or inform the customer that the service is down.

This functionality helps improve your overall error-handling capability by introducing standards-based error responses that are backward compatible with OOTB error handlers, with greater flexibility and control.

[Enhanced authentication methods for Form Data Model](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/integrate/use-form-data-model/configure-data-sources.html): Experience heightened security with the introduction of Client Credentials based authentication to connect AEM Forms (Form Data Models) with compatible data sources. This enhancement eliminates the need for impersonation or user login, bolstering the protection of your data.

[Create Adaptive Forms with repeatable sections](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/adaptive-forms-authoring/authoring-adaptive-forms-core-components/create-an-adaptive-form-on-forms-cs/create-forms-repeatable-sections.html): You can now make Accordion, Wizard, Panel, and Horizontal Tabs components in a Core Components based Adaptive Form to create repeatable sections.

These repeatable sections allow you to provide an unlimited number of entries without a fixed field count. It is useful when the required instances of data are unknown in advance. Forms users can easily add or remove sections, making forms adaptable to different data entry scenarios and simplifying collection of multiple occurrences of the same data.

[Submit Adaptive Forms to Microsoft&reg; SharePoint and Microsoft&reg; OneDrive](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/adaptive-forms-authoring/authoring-adaptive-forms-foundation-components/configure-submit-actions-and-metadata-submission/configuring-submit-actions.html): You can now submit [!UICONTROL Adaptive Forms] data to everyday tools like Microsoft&reg; SharePoint Site or Microsoft&reg; OneDrive.

#### [!UICONTROL Headless Adaptive Forms] early adopter program

Use [Headless Adaptive Forms](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-headless-adaptive-forms/using/overview.html) to enable your developers to create, publish, and manage interactive forms that can be accessed and interacted with through APIs, rather than through a traditional graphical user interface. [!UICONTROL Headless Adaptive Forms] help you:

* Build high-quality multi-channel forms in the programming language of your choice
* Natively integrate forms to your desktop and mobile apps, websites, and chat applications
* Reuse your proprietary UI components with forms applications
* Use the power of Adobe Experience Manager Forms

You can send an email to [aem-forms-headless@adobe.com](mailto:certif@adobe.com) from your official email ID to join the early adopter program.

### [!DNL Cloud Manager]

_New features_

* Cards on the Cloud Manager landing page now indicate if [Enhanced Security](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/using-cloud-manager/programs/creating-production-programs.html) is enabled for their programs.
* If a development [pipeline](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/using-cloud-manager/cicd-pipelines/introduction-ci-cd-pipelines.html) contains no testing steps, users now have the option to include testing steps when they [start the pipeline](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/using-cloud-manager/cicd-pipelines/managing-pipelines.html?#running-pipelines).
* This will be rolled out in a phased manner.
* When [cancelling execution](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/using-cloud-manager/cicd-pipelines/managing-pipelines.html?#view-details), the pipeline execution approval step now asks the user to provide a reason for cancelling.
* This will be rolled out in a phased manner.

_Bug fixes_

* Navigating to the authoring UI from [!UICONTROL Cloud Manager] no longer fails to redirect into Unified Shell after login.
* Editing the go-live date via the go-live widget now navigates to the **[!UICONTROL Go Live]** tab instead of the **[!UICONTROL Enhanced Security]** tab.
* When starting a copy operation, a user will no longer be able to select an environment where a copy operation is already invoked.

### New features in Customer Journey Analytics {#cust-journey}

| Feature | Description | [General Availability](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/technotes/releases.html) - Target Date |
| ----------- | ---------- | ----- |
|  Binding Dimension and Binding Metric persistence options | When creating or editing a data view, you can bind the persistence of a dimension to another dimension or metric. This concept is known as "Merchandising" in Reports & Analytics, and is now supported in CJA. | January 19, 2022 |
| “First Known” and “Last Known” allocation models | These two new allocation models take the first or last observed value for a dimension within a specified persistence scope (session, person, or custom time period with lookback.) Then they apply the allocation model to all events within the specified scope. | January 19, 2022 |
| personID and personID namespace as dimensions | Exposes the personID (or customerID, or whatever ID you are using for merging data sets in a connection) as a dimension in data views. This enhancement makes it easier for you to include the personID as a dimension in your data view by pulling it in from the connection. | January 19, 2022 |

| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| EOL for Reports & Analytics | January 4, 2022 | Effective **December 31, 2023**, Adobe intends to discontinue Reports & Analytics and its accompanying reports and features. The reports, visualizations and underlying technology that power Reports & Analytics no longer meet Adobe’s technology standards. Most Reports & Analytics features are available in [Analysis Workspace](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/home.html). Since the release of Analysis Workspace in 2015, Reports & Analytics functionality and capabilities have been moved to Analysis Workspace and a threshold of workflow parity has been reached. [This notice](https://spark.adobe.com/page/6WnF8JK6IRDhf/) explains the end-of-life process. | 
| "Global + China" RDC Type | November 22, 2021 | "Global + China" is a new Regional Data Collection (RDC) type that simplifies routing of traffic for global customers using the [!UICONTROL China Performance Optimization Add-On Package]. In the past, you had to determine whether data should be routed to the China collection endpoint or one of the Global collection endpoints. Now you can choose this RDC **type** to let Adobe determine the optimal collection endpoint based on the geolocation of the user. |
| EOL for Full Processing in Data Sources | October 18, 2021 | On **January 31, 2022**, Adobe will end of life Full Processing, which enables users to ingest offline hit data into Analytics. This capability is available via [Bulk Data Insertion API](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experiencecloud/analytics/docs.html#!AdobeDocs/analytics-2.0-apis/master/bdia.md).

### New features across [!DNL Advertising Cloud] {#adcloud-all}

Last updated: **October 27, 2021**

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Analytics for Advertising Cloud | If your organization wants to switch from using the legacy Adobe Analytics `visitorAPI.js` library to the Adobe Experience Platform library (`alloy.js`) for data collection, you'll need to make some changes to enable ID stitching. See "[Using the [!DNL Last Event Service] JavaScript Library with Adobe Experience Platform [!DNL Web SDK]](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/advertising-cloud/integrations/analytics/planning/web-sdk.html)." |

{style="table-layout:auto"}

### New features in [!DNL Advertising Cloud DSP] {#adcloud-dsp}

Last updated: **October 27, 2021**

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Custom Reports | You can now create and manage [!DNL Amazon S3] and different types of FTP delivery locations, called *[!DNL report destinations]*, for your custom reports. Once you configure report destinations, you can set up each of your new custom reports to be delivered to one or more locations of a single destination type, or to email recipients. Updates to your [!DNL Amazon S3] and FTP credentials won't interrupt report delivery.<br><br>Your existing reports are still sent to the specified email recipients. To configure delivery to a different report destination, create a new report with the new destination. |
| [!UICONTROL Packages], [!UICONTROL Placements], and [!UICONTROL Ads] views| When you view data for a single day, the trend charts now include hourly data. Hold the cursor over any point to see the data for that hour. |
| [!UICONTROL Placements] | The placement [!UICONTROL Inspector] now includes an [!UICONTROL Inventory] tab, which shows all deals and their associated metrics for the placement. Use the information to make quick adjustments or troubleshoot issues without generating a custom report. |
| [!UICONTROL Ads] | (Users with permission to include Clearcastclock numbers in their ads) DSP no longer shows an error if you use a clock number that's attached to another ad. **Note:**  The best practice is to use a unique clock number for each video ad. Otherwise, the publisher won't approve all of the ads. |
| [!UICONTROL Deal IDs] | The [!UICONTROL Deal ID] settings and other places in the user interface reflect new branding for [!DNL Magnite] SSP:<br><ul><li>The SSP "[!DNL Tremor]" ([!DNL Telaria]) is now "[!DNL Magnite CTV]."</li><li>In the coming weeks, [!DNL Rubicon]" will change to "[!DNL Magnite DV+]," where [!DNL DV+] stands for display, video, and other formats such as audio.</li></ul> |
| [!DNL Freewheel] programmatic guaranteed deals | You can now find the status of ads for [!DNL Freewheel] programmatic guaranteed deals from the [!UICONTROL Ads] view. Previously, you could check the status only from the [!UICONTROL Deals] view. |

{style="table-layout:auto"}

### New features in [!DNL Advertising Cloud Search] {#adcloud-search}

Last updated: **October 7, 2021**

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [!UICONTROL Reports], [!UICONTROL Notification Center] | (October 9 release) All email notifications for reports, which Advertising Cloud Search sends when a custom or scheduled report has completed or failed, are now handled by [!UICONTROL Notification Center]. Email notifications and web notifications are enabled by default for reports, but you can optionally change the notification settings. With this change:<ul><li>Email recipients are restricted to users who are registered, authenticated users of Advertising Cloud Search and have access to the advertiser account. This feature ensures that no confidential data is sent to unauthorized users.</li><li>The format and contents of the email uses the [!UICONTROL Notification Center] template, which includes more details of the report and includes direct download links for all report formats.</li><li>Report notifications are a new notification type, with its own notification preferences, in [!UICONTROL Notification Center].</li></ul>If you use any automation to pull reports from email notifications, you may need to update the filtering logic to ensure process continuity. |
| Advertising Insights | Additional insights are available in beta mode. |

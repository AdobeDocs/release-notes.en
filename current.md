Before the launch of this feature, personalization offered by AEM is available only for site pages, but not for Experience Fragments
* The [Content Fragment Console](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/sites/administering/content-fragments/content-fragments-console.html) now lets users efficiently manage translated content fragments. A one-click access is available to view all the language copies. Users can filter the table view by the locale of their interest.

_New feature available in prerelease channel_

* [!DNL Experience Manager Assets] now [supports SAS Token](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/manage/add-assets.html?lang=en#asset-bulk-ingestor) in addition to the Access Key for authentication while connecting to Azure Blob Storage data source for ingesting assets using the [!UICONTROL Bulk Import] tool.

The wizard has a quick tab navigation to easily select pre-configured template, styling, fields, and submission options to create an adaptive form. This release brings following improvements to the wizard:
  * Select or deselect fields: The wizard allows you to create an [!UICONTROL Adaptive Form] based on JSON and Form Data Model schemas. You can now select subset of fields within a schema to include in an [!UICONTROL Adaptive Form]. The selected fields are converted to corresponding [!UICONTROL Adaptive Form] data capture components to quickly create the desired adaptive forms.
  * Use [!UICONTROL Static Templates]: Customers with existing investments in legacy-static templates can continue their journey of cloud adoption by using static templates in the wizard to author adaptive forms. This provides additional time to customers to migrate old static templates to modern editable templates.
* [Remove hidden fields from a Document of Record (DoR) while server-side processing](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/create-an-adaptive-form/generate-document-of-record-for-non-xfa-based-adaptive-forms.html?lang=en): You can generate the document of record PDF for end users containing only those fields which were visible to them during data capture experience. Upon form submission, the server validates which fields were hidden to the end user based on submitted data and excludes from document of record for consistency.

_New features available in prerelease channel_

* **[!UICONTROL Adaptive Forms] template editor** - Template editor lets you pre-define the basic structure and appearance of [!UICONTROL Adaptive Forms] of an organization. This release brings following improvements to the template editor:

It helps reduce the time taken to create an [!UICONTROL Adaptive Form]. The option is also added to [!UICONTROL Adaptive Forms] editor to let users select or change Form Data Model for existing forms.
  * **[Document of Record in template editor](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/create-an-adaptive-form/generate-document-of-record-for-non-xfa-based-adaptive-forms.html?lang=en#document-of-record-support-in-adaptive-form-editor-dor-support-in-adaptiveform)** - You can now standardize Document of Record generation for all forms created using a template. This ability helps enhance compliance and standardization for organization requirements.
* **[Launch the Adaptive Form wizard from a AEM Sites Page](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/integrate/embed-adaptive-form-aem-sites.html?lang=en)** - AEM Sites page has extended support for [!UICONTROL Adaptive Forms].

Last updated: **August 9, 2022**

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Integration with [!DNL Adobe Analytics] | (August 6 release) Improvements to the data feed that Advertising sends to [!DNL Analytics] result in fewer mismatches between click/cost/impression data from the search engines and related conversion data in [!DNL Analytics]. |

### New features in [!DNL Advertising DSP] {#advertising-dsp}

Last updated: **February 8, 2023**

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [!UICONTROL Campaigns] | (February 3 release; beta features) You can now view change logs in chart form, and you can add notes to any entry. |

{style="table-layout:auto"}

### New features in [!DNL Advertising Search] {#advertising-search}

Last updated: **February 10, 2023**

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [!UICONTROL Campaigns] | (February 6 release; beta feature) Read-only sync support is now available for your [!DNL Google Ads] discovery campaigns. Discovery campaigns have [!UICONTROL Campaign Type] "[!UICONTROL Discovery]," [!UICONTROL Ad Group Type] "[!UICONTROL Discovery]," and [!UICONTROL Creative Type] "[!UICONTROL Discovery Ad]" (for single-image ads) or "[!UICONTROL Discovery Carousel Ad]" (for multi-image carousel ads). You can include discovery campaigns in standard and hybrid portfolios.<br><br>Ad-level data for your discovery campaigns is available in reports. For advertisers with an Adobe Analytics integration, ad-level data is available in [!DNL Analytics]. Similarly, [!DNL Analytics] data is available in [!DNL Search]; the data is sent using the upgraded `s_kwcid` tracking parameter, regardless of the `s_kwcid` format you normally use for the account. If you normally use the older version of the `s_kwcid`, then your click/cost data and revenue data are tracked using different `s_kwcids`, but both sets of data are fully classified and aggregated under the same campaign and account. |
|  | ([!DNL Google Ads] accounts; February 11 release) Support for the "[!UICONTROL Target Impression Share]" bid strategy is now available for campaigns on the search network only. For this bid strategy, [!DNL Google Ads] (not [!DNL Search]) optimizes bids in order to achieve a target impression share and ad position. You can optionally enter a [!UICONTROL Target Impression Share] as a percent, the [!UICONTROL Target Ad Position], and a [!UICONTROL Max CPC] (cost per click). This option isn't yet supported in hybrid portfolios. |
| [!UICONTROL Bulksheets] | ([!DNL Microsoft] campaigns; February 11 release) Bulksheets now include "[!UICONTROL Call to Action]" and "[!UICONTROL Call to Action Language]" columns for multimedia ads (in responsive ad format), which use the "[!UICONTROL Creative (except RSA)]" row. |
